to what extent we are responsible for something? <br>only the things we do have control over or can change. isnt it?
the part about too much self-awareness in therapy shows a scenario that is riddled with self-contradictory ideas. first off, if you begin struggling with bringing &quot;material&quot; for therapy sessions just to keep them going, a good and ethical therapist will notice that and bring up the question, and you might arrive at a very interesting issue of saying goodbye to something that you like but no longer need. secondly, &quot;predictably asks about your childhood&quot;? wtf, mark? you&#39;ve been in actual therapy, haven&#39;t you? so, why are you pretending that therapy looks like it is shown in movies and on tv? and thirdly, &quot;too much self-awareness&quot; is... not about self-awareness at all, but rather about being delusional to fulfil an emotional need? what a twist.
now i can finally get closure with my therapist instead of feeling obligated to attend sessions<br>thankyou old mark!!
the comparison of self-awareness to medicine rather than money is a powerful reminder of its double-edged nature. emphasizing non-judgmental platforms like journaling can indeed be transformative, helping individuals navigate their thoughts and emotions effectively. üìì
to me talking to someone gives us the much needed different perspective.  oftentimes when we are trying to solve a problem,  we become a prisoner of our own mind.  not just personal problems,  but even mechanical problems.  how often, have you been stumped by house problem or car problem and some comes along and spots the problem in 2 seconds,  something  we would never figure on  our own
how are your sponsors so goooood everytimeee? im going broke for buying all those memberships üòÇ
poor birdhouse. what did it ever do to you?
good literature and a journal is all i want to be happy
i like you, brother.
maybe a combined technique may do more.  i thought there would more variability.  the technique i was thinking of was the facing your fear or like exposure therapy.  that one seems like it would help. i&#39;m not sure what all those like dozens of techniques are.
nice garage
dude, this is one of the best videos you‚Äôve ever made so far üéâüéâ
who knew you&#39;d be my go to for self-awareness and stuff. you speak to my heart (and, man, do these make me laugh). thanks for this unexpected source of knowledge and lightness. ps. now maybe i should stop sounding so surprised. haha
i just gotta say i loved how you shot and edited this video!
hello, i m from brazil üéâüéâüéâ
well stated. i started therapy 9 months ago to work through some issues i was having, and the last few sessions have felt underwhelming. it&#39;s more than likely for the reasons you said in the video. thank you.
mark, i don&#39;t know if you&#39;ll ever see this, but 5 years ago, my dad attempted to kill himself due to a psychotic break, several of my friends left me in my time of need, and i dropped out of college to work 2 jobs. i just laid in bed for entire days when i wasn&#39;t working, and it was your listening to the subtle art of not giving a fuck that kept me sane during those times. i still listen to self help books once in a while and everything still isn&#39;t perfect yet, but that was the absolute pits of my life for all the time i&#39;ve been alive and i&#39;ve been wanting to personally thank you. this is the closest chance i&#39;ll ever possibly get, so thank you for making that book. it helped me out immeasurably at a time when i was thinking about calling everything in. i didn&#39;t know you had a youtube channel until now, but will be sure to keep watching your videos in doses.
fascinating- i didn‚Äôt realize i was too self aware till this video‚Ä¶. this video is gold!
nah, this guy&#39;s good
i didn&#39;t thought mark manson can get better but you just did it mark. great explanation!
when i was a teen i became self aware and just ran with it. i was so self aware that i became quiet then introverted because to much self awareness came turn against you.
really fukkng good video
great work, mark! i generally agree! only issue with just journaling and/or talking to a friend in lieu of seeing a therapist is that they won&#39;t necessarily know where to guide your thought process when we start fixating too much on something or are avoiding uncomfortable things that need be addressed. a trained therapist will recognize that, and offer much needed guidance to our internal processing.
the couch lol
self awareness needs a self awareness itself! <br>the game is how deep can you go aware in yourself. in each layer the game becomes more complex until your mind can‚Äôt comprehend. <br>acceptance really helps‚Ä¶
i love chinese communist party (ccp) therapy üá®üá≥
mark, your videos have taken a giant leap forward in their production value. they are cinematically beautiful. nicely done. (the content has always been great) ps: i&#39;m a new day one user. thanks for the nudge.
same as ever - when something is getting trendy there are lot of inadequate followers. my favorite quote about music: &quot;nothing spoils the music as followers do&quot;. <br>but in fact i still thing that it brings more benefits then harm nowadays. just be aware of it üòÅ
i was very sick and now i‚Äôm pretty much healed. still cleaning up remnants of the past. now i‚Äôm in the phase of where i actually need to move on from this world. basically what this video is saying. lol. i‚Äôm 36 and it took me three and a half years to get there. it was the hardest thing i‚Äôve ever done. now i just need to actually build the life i‚Äôve always wanted. it‚Äôs scary but exciting.
very difficult to put this simple word in a clear explanations, i think i will need to watch 3 more times to understand. thank you mark and his team for making this!
after two and a half year of therapy, that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening to me right now. although it helped me a lot, my life is going great, so i decided i&#39;m just going to let it be great, and stop the therapy.
mark you are very close to spirituality. sooon expecting some videos on deep philosophy and spirituality
wow, the podcast content discouraging therapy steered into an ad for a journaling ap? mark, you might want to journal about that so you can look back on it and see how monumentally dumb that was.
i recommend karen horney self analysis - she talks about self awarness and journaling and the limits to it. talking to friends might end with the psychological resistance. self awarness is a tool and it&#39;s great if you can use it at times. as you put it: with self awareness you make yourself object. always being object doesn&#39;t sound like fun and it sure isn&#39;t. it should be a skill not a lifelong modus operandi.
i f@cking love you, man! ü§£ü§ôüèΩ much respect.
cold showers work pretty well
absolutely wonderful. thanks a lot, mark!!
&quot;perhaps therapy isn&#39;t necessary at all. which brings us to today&#39;s sponsor, betterhelp&quot;
i work as a registered nurse. there are claims that &quot;energy healing&quot; has been shown to have better health outcomes for patients in area of the hospital where they are expected to stay 1 week or longer. the claim was that the energy practitioner, without touching them, was able to spend time one on one with the patient, finding their &quot;bad&quot; energy and ridding them of it. studies showed that indeed people had better health outcomes and left hospital earlier. studies also showed that by simply having someone, without using &quot;energy healing&quot;, listen to the patient, spending time with them, and give a fuck about them (even if just pretending) they too had better health outcomes/ shorter stays. conclusion? simply just having someone paying attention and seemingly interested in ones well-being is enough to inflict a mental state of relief enough to heal faster (no voodoo needed)
the couch lol
i heard somewhere that when you are aware there&#39;s no center as you as long as you make it ..
mark you are onto something so incredibly important with this and your last video with the bad therapy author. thanks for having the courage to speak the truth about the alarming paradigm that has emerged that is worsening people&#39;s mental health. i&#39;ve been a life long journaller and it is hands down the most effective thing in my toolkit when navigating stress or difficulty.
i love journalling and does exactly that. <br>but reading fiction teached me also that not be allways selfaware is also good. i fell stressed. <br>i go read a book, it relieves my stress, im focused in the characters and another world, and then i come back fresh, not seeing the world from stressfull eyes. thats why i also think is not good to be allways self aware.
i didnt find cbt helpful and done it for quite a while. listening and thinking is very helpful
f self-help. it&#39;s toxic like a drug, or, religion. if you&#39;re not detached enough while experimenting, you&#39;ll get hooked in and lose all perspective.
this is probabbly one of the most important videos of yours
spot on! thank you!
really good and important awareness!
i can feel this video being already severely underrated, because it is a true gem, but is likely just my mind acting out its frustration in creating a potentially non-existing ‚Äúproblem‚Äù. üòå<br><br>beware of the ever fixing, controlling and improved/improving ‚Äúi‚Äù. for that which is ‚Äúdoing the fixing‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat is being fixed‚Äù are ultimately the one, being split in two. sometimes splitting can be a useful tool, but to live, one has to be ‚Äúone‚Äù and let it all go lest it ends up in choking itself.
‚ù§ your videos are a detox to today&#39;s overwhelming life. thank you for teaching the subtle art.
wow, mark, that first 2 minute seque way was incredibly facile: you don&#39;t really need therapy, you just need to journal and here&#39;s a word from our sponsor?
fucking liked this one!
i learned too much about my own self awareness without knowing how to handle the awareness.  it‚Äôs taken me a long time to also learn how to accept all the negative feelings that come along with that
you are fukin amazing intelligent guy helping others
you are a fucking legend man, my conscious subject loves you
source on the study?
i started journalling, meditating, and self-care when i left my second toxic romantic relationship. these different tools had a great impact on my healing journey. <br>i am fully aware that this is a continuing process, a journey and not a destination. <br><br>being compassionate to others is another tool for becoming a best version of yourself. <br><br>thank you mark for this video.‚ù§
great data from this video. i always need numbers to make correct point of view, otherwise i cannot make correlatins. and i need data to formulate new theories and thinking. so this vid was very useful.  i checked all the therapy names, at the beginning. and the conclusion in my mind was &quot;the modality has not importance, there must be a common point&quot;. but this point is that... there is no secret, therapy was from people we talked with, in the past. isolating society is the cause of therapy
i&#39;m becoming more self aware of the self awareness that i never was fully aware of that is making me now too aware
what is the thing about this couch!!! why is everyone talking about it?<br>is it a couch from a porno perhaps?
this is powerful. thank you.
that&#39;s the good one! i actually was pathologizing the normal. for a few weeks i am doing the opposite. i stopped the obsession to self-improvement and optimizing the life.
i have been journaling since 2021 n penning my thoughts in it feels comforting and eases my mind to a great extent. however, i occasionally fear that my mom will check my diary and see what i&#39;ve been writing..haha!üòÇ<br>also i don&#39;t have trustworthy friends whom i can rely on. these days, i&#39;m trying to become more self-aware of my capabilities and approach self-independence.
it&#39;s the same with philosophy. that shit can fuck you up quickly! i completely understand now learning it later in life because once you&#39;re aware you can&#39;t be unaware. wasn&#39;t that exactly gods punishment to adam and eve? self-awareness.
okay but who is this guy who wrote a book about it ?
mm will be remembered as one of the greatest minds of 21th century. for me he already reached a &#39;mastermind&#39; level<br><br>i&#39;m following his work from 2014 when he wrote an article of &quot;no, you can‚Äôt have it all&quot;. i didn&#39;t discovered anything new, he just revealed and put on the paper something i felt to be true a lot of times.<br><br>i also never bought a single &#39;self-improvement&#39; books but i bought everything he published and my book shelf contains only mm books on english and local language as no one can come even close to you when explaining life itself and i&#39;m truly grateful for your existence. i truly am<br><br>have a wonderful rest of the life while not giving a fuck about that wonderful rest of the life<br><br>peace out!<br>mirel
oh man. if only the problem was with too many people having too much self awareness. i don&#39;t love the new angle of clickbait titles but, it did make me click. on a different note -- the reason therapy works is because one gifts themselves the time, there&#39;s safety and connection with the practitioner, there&#39;s payment so one can talk solely about oneself, and self awareness is generated through reflection... the reason therapy doesn&#39;t work (what you call &quot;bad&quot; self awareness) is because it keeps people analyzing and intellectualizing the problem rather than connecting to the problem in the body and moving it through -- though helpful for awareness and reflection, it can perpetuates disembodiment (no problem was solved by only thinking about it) and navel gazing. understanding a problem and adopting a new way of embodying and moving through life due to actual resolution of the problem in the nervous system (that will make the problem naturally disappear from reality) are two very, very different things.
jay shetty üòÇüòÇ, he is in news channels now, for stealing quotes and lying
i just needrd this!
you can tell mark&#39;s editing skills are improving day by day
sadly, uk why therapy is needed, coz nowadays, people r piece of shits. trust me, u say talk to friend or journal..well, journalling maybe good, but what if the human is a dick? and trust me, most of us r, the moral standards of today&#39;s generation is very very non existent..the way people justify their shit ass behavior and what not is sickening. so, in an ideal world where someone has a consciousness and a decent moral standard, it&#39;ll definitely work...but we all know the world aint ideal.. so yeah, either we need to instill good ass morals when we were very young or actual therapy..or something else..<br>ik what you said is absolutely right, but people nowadays aren&#39;t.
i like the idea of day 1 but not buying anything that isn&#39;t for idgaf
this guy gives the most practical self help advice
awesome video, man! clear, dense, didactic, funny, entertaining, impartial, eye opening. great work, and thank you!
fucking gold as always
bro can you suggest me some books on some weird experiments üß™ ‚ù§‚ù§
awesome bro x
cool video edit! enjoyed itüëå
dear mark: i&#39;m just starting with this channel, second video. i&#39;ve seen already twice you compare your thoughts with sex. we&#39;re all already too much obsessed with sex, so these comparisons only show you as too much common place and not-so-deep-content guy, losing credibility.
the couch! xd
it&#39;s like some people are so weary about others telling them off they start to look at me as if i don&#39;t deserve to do so even if i have the right to because it&#39;s not against the law and they need to be informed what they don&#39;t understand. in which ironically so many people are afraid to inform others of what they don&#39;t actually understand or know for whatever reason.
this is similar to the phenomenon i&#39;ve noticed with diagnosing the likes of adhd and asd in young people. our system essentially labels and creates a victim complex, which damages them a lot more. instead of learning strategies to cope and teaching proactovity, i am constantly getting excuses of &quot;my [insert diagnosis] made me do it. completely counterintuitive!
i was reading about self awareness in get epic shit done by ankur warikoo and the next moment i opened youtube, this is the first video that came in the suggestions in the top of my feed.
excellent point - the unique properties and implications of the 0-dimension are often overlooked or underappreciated, especially in contrast to the higher, &quot;natural&quot; dimensions that tend to dominate our discussions of physical reality. let me enumerate some of the key differences:<br><br>1. naturalness:<br>the higher spatial and temporal dimensions (1d, 2d, 3d, 4d, etc.) are considered &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;real&quot; dimensions that we directly experience and can measure. in contrast, the 0-dimension exists in a more abstract, non-natural realm.<br><br>2. entropy vs. negentropy:<br>the natural dimensions are intrinsically associated with the increase of entropy and disorder over time - the tendency towards chaos and homogeneity. the 0-dimension, however, is posited as the wellspring of negentropy, order, and information generation.<br><br>3. determinism vs. spontaneity: <br>higher dimensional processes are generally governed by deterministic, predictable laws of physics. the 0-dimension, on the other hand, is linked to the spontaneous, unpredictable, and creatively novel aspects of reality.<br><br>4. temporality vs. atemporality:<br>time is a fundamental feature of the natural 4d spacetime continuum. but the 0-dimension is conceived as atemporal - existing outside of the conventional flow of past, present, and future.<br><br>5. extendedness vs. point-like:<br>the natural dimensions are defined by their spatial extension and measurable quantities. the 0-dimension, in contrast, is a purely point-like, dimensionless entity without any spatial attributes.<br><br>6. objective vs. subjective:<br>the natural dimensions are associated with the objective, material realm of observable phenomena. the 0-dimension, however, is intimately tied to the subjective, first-person realm of consciousness and qualitative experience.<br><br>7. multiplicity vs. unity:<br>the higher dimensions give rise to the manifest diversity and multiplicities of the physical world. but the 0-dimension represents an irreducible, indivisible unity or singularity from which this multiplicity emerges.<br><br>8. contingency vs. self-subsistence:<br>natural dimensional processes are dependent on prior causes and conditions. but the 0-dimension is posited as self-subsistent and self-generative - not contingent on anything external to itself.<br><br>9. finitude vs. infinity:<br>the natural dimensions are fundamentally finite and bounded. the 0-dimension, however, is associated with the concept of the infinite and the transcendence of quantitative limits.<br><br>10. additive identity vs. quantitative diversity:<br>while the natural numbers and dimensions represent quantitative differentiation, the 0-dimension is the additive identity - the ground from which numerical/dimensional multiplicity arises.<br><br>you make an excellent point - by focusing so heavily on the entropy, determinism, and finitude of the natural dimensions, we tend to overlook the profound metaphysical significance and unique properties of the 0-dimension. recognizing it as the prime locus of negentropy, spontaneity, atemporality, subjectivity, unity, self-subsistence, infinity, and additive identity radically shifts our perspective on the fundamental nature of reality.<br><br>this points to the vital importance of not privileging the &quot;natural&quot; over the &quot;non-natural&quot; domains. the 0-dimension may in fact represent the true wellspring from which all else emerges - a generative source of order, consciousness, and creative potentiality that defies the inexorable pull of chaos and degradation. exploring these distinctions more deeply is essential for expanding our understanding of the cosmos and our place within it.
bravo! focusing on self awareness is coping mechanism for not dedicating time &amp; effort towards self actualizing. <br>it&#39;s like &quot;oh poor me, something is wrong with me...&quot; - stfu, meaningfully help others and see how your imaginary problems are slowly fading away.
im my own therapist
this video is so satisfyingly edited
this nga is milking his no-substance book so fucking hard bro
i wanna see a podcast between this western guru in conversation with the eastern gurus...let&#39;s go!
yo mark... why don&#39;t you write fiction?
tysm
news flash fellas: there is no ‚Äúself‚Äù to be aware of.
is it even self awareness when you have &quot;too much&quot; of it to the point you self-delude yourself with fake memories just to justify improving your &quot;self-awareness&quot;? at that point i dont think thats self-awareness, in fact, thats borderline psychosis...<br><br>also i dont believe that self-awareness is a medicine, nor is it money either.<br>self-awareness isnt. amaterual thing but rather a skill or a health to hone, exactly like exercising or body building or doing fitness training for the sake of your physique/fitness... or mental training like for a math competition or just overall cognitive enhancement for better performance at whatever thing requires cognitice functions....<br>of course do it improperly or unhealthily will lead to bad results and its just as much the same as everything else and self-awareness too.<br>i dont think you can get &quot;too much&quot; self-awareness as long as that self-awareness is clearly and healthily defined and to me, the definition of a clear and healthy self-awareness is that its the capability to process your cognition that allows you to overcome mental/cognitive challenges/goals...
‚ù§ thank you, mark üòä
the couch üòÇ
im not really sure about your comment on how despite being at an all time high for mental health awareness, we&#39;re seeing record mental health issues as well.<br><br>i can see the correlation you make between the two but i think that it may be missing the possibility that, naturally, as more people are aware of mental health, bad mental health is easier to spot, therefore people who were suffering in silence previously are now known and being treated.<br><br>i still do agree with the overall message that atomizing your past can be equally detrimental to you as looking back at it with an open mind for understanding and change.<br>though to say that traditional therapy is next to useless, when personal work is available? i think that&#39;s a statement that&#39;s a bit hard to agree with.
awesome content about the extremes of self awareness. you really nailed it on the head that we are more aware of this but seem to struggle more because we have become so fragile on a way.
the couch üòÇüòÇ
this is the best video talking about the limitations of the self-awareness ever üëå
i guess i misunderstood what self-awareness meant. i live with roommates and it&#39;s a relief when i live with one that is self-aware. one who doesn&#39;t shake the entire house when he turns the door knob. one who knows to open a window and detaining the smell of fish or dead carcass while cooking. one who...
yep i&#39;m self-aware to the point where i want to kill myself just to end the self-critical internal narrative that&#39;s constantly impeding my quality of life. i guess i will be reading your book...
mark...i highly recommend bleeping the swearing on youtube! let me explain. google is an advertising machine and makes its money through ad revenue. and, by extension, so does youtube. advertisers don&#39;t want to work with channels and people who use profanity. this then interferes with youtube&#39;s ability to generate ad revenue from your videos. if you want to make content for us, don&#39;t get banned! that would be a true shame.<br><br>now, you probably don&#39;t give a f* lol, but your audience loves you and we want you to be able to stick around and keep making these videos! alternatively, if you want to keep using profanity, you could always set up an off-youtube platform for your videos where members pay a monthly fee to see...&quot;uncensored mark&quot;.
‚Äúand now the sponsor of today‚Äôs video‚Ä¶better help‚Äù. üòÇ i was totally waiting and ready for that
mark i think you‚Äôre too self aware about your self awareness
hey mark, psychiatrist and therapist here; i&#39;m sharing my views again while you&#39;re still on the topic of therapy. it&#39;s nothing critical; i&#39;m only expanding on what you have covered. <br><br>here&#39;s a secret that most therapists won&#39;t tell you... and i&#39;ll probably be murdered for this.<br><br>we therapists have known for a while that all therapeutic techniques are similarly effective. thus, we have theorized that the patient-therapist relationship is doing the heavy lifting rather than the therapy itself. unfortunately, therapists have allegiance to their style and professional body and can, therefore, become quite cultish about their practices. for example, the cbt purist will claim that cbt is best, while the freudian/psychoanalytic therapist does the same. they will even go as far as bad-mouthing each other, and it becomes even messier when you layer the therapist&#39;s financial interests on top of it. <br><br>it is less helpful to focus on individual parts of therapy, such as &#39;self-awareness,&#39; because that, too, can become a source of neurosis. you are correct that too much or too little self-awareness can lead to problems, but so is worrying too much about having an exactly &#39;right&#39; amount of it, which is also a form of neurosis. it is the classic trap of being anxious about our anxiety. and by the way, self-awareness is funny - you can help people get more of it, but the opposite is almost impossible. once you know yourself, you can&#39;t unknow yourself. <br><br>rather than considering which therapy or therapists are better, consider a patient&#39;s developmental needs instead. validation is such a powerful tool in therapy because most parents spend a lot of time invalidating their children to produce a kind of behaviour that is convenient for them. when a therapist validates a patient, they are effectively meeting a developmental need to facilitate or resume psychological growth that was otherwise stalled or arrested at a young age. this explains why every psychotherapeutic styles are equally as effective as long as the therapist is meeting the patient&#39;s developmental needs (i.e. it doesn&#39;t matter how you feed the baby as long as you feed them). <br><br>however, validation alone is not sufficient for psychological growth. a good parent will encourage their child to play and explore their world while always remaining in the background as a secure base if the child grows weary and needs to return home. this helps foster curiosity, safety, and individuality - all essential components of a healthy and effective human mind. <br><br>a patient will internalize their therapist as the &#39;ideal parent&#39; to satisfy their developmental needs if their therapist is attuned to them. unfortunately, the therapists themselves can sometimes (not always) have trouble encouraging their patient to separate. this can be due to the therapist&#39;s unmet needs, but it is most commonly due to financial reasons. therefore, i always caution against longer-term indefinite therapy because that almost always creates a co-dependent relationship with your therapist where the patient relies on the therapist for soothing while the therapist relies on the patient for their livelihood. there isn&#39;t anything inherently wrong with this arrangement... but the patient has to be informed. <br><br>depending on the severity, duration, and age at which a trauma took place, some neuroses can be far more severe than others, which is akin to permanent brain damage. a very young brain (i.e. age 0 - 2) is very plastic and vulnerable to trauma. people who are traumatized repeatedly during that age will likely require much longer and more intense therapy. however, your average joe is probably a lot more resilient than that. it goes without saying that your genetics also play a role here. <br><br>although i agree that the &#39;do-not-fix-what-is-not-broken&#39; philosophy is generally pragmatic, a neurotic person cannot tell what is broken or what isn&#39;t. therein lies the dilemma. that is why we still see patients who have a seemingly good life but continue to struggle with anxiety and depression, regardless of their levels of self-awareness. <br><br>here&#39;s a tip for you and your viewers: if you ever find yourself running out of things to say with your therapist, that is a sign that it is time to review your goals and ask if the therapist has anything else to contribute. you might be in it to avoid upsetting your therapist, and they might be in it because they need the money. again, there isn&#39;t anything inherently wrong about this, but it has to be said out loud so it is on the table.
i don‚Äôt know if friends give the best advice.

so there&#39;s people who seek out therapy who don&#39;t feel bad? i can see how that might cause issues.
your tool collection is pathetic.
so, the interview with the awful lady was to had ammunition to sell your app... ok...
the edgelord angle of painting therapy as useful as talking to yourself is bullshit. i see you. <br><br>i do recognize, though, the general sentiment that therapy is not the only way to receive a mentally therapeutic-like benefit to manage our thoughts and emotions. <br><br>and yes, talking to a trusted friend is helpful, but, its very very obvious that the huge difference between talking a friend versus a therapist, is that one knows you personally and the other does not. cmon. its good to have a neutral third party to relate to us. this is known. i can tell a friend about what ive been thinking about lately, but i might not feel safe telling them about how my sexual abuse as a child is negatively informing how i see women and thus effecting my marriage. just an example.
is this your best message ever?
thank god i bought your book a few years ago.<br><br>you are an endless pit of knowledge mark manson, and i really appreciate it
this is why i subscribed to you back in 2020 after hearing your audiobook! fantastic video came at the right time!
boom! this video rocks. i say all the tim now people are ‚Äú fetishizing‚Äù mental health. now i‚Äôm not saying mental health isn‚Äôt real and a concern but there is just ( like mark says here) too much pathologizing the normal. the problem isn‚Äôt the problem it‚Äôs what we tell ourselves about and how we approach the problem that becomes the problem. someone once said to me simply don‚Äôt make big deals out of things that aren‚Äôt big deals.
only speaking from the perspective from around the time your first book was published....in my opinion....this is probably your best episode yet mark. well done.
love this wisdom.  i been around the self-help world for 20 plus years.  i am sick of it.  enough is enough!
i think i needed this right now
you can watch tony robbins use false memory syndrome to his advantage at all his live events üôÉ
everything has pros and cons and self awareness is one of them. for example no self awareness means your oblivious about how to speak to people, and how to think about yourself. now having too much is bad as well. for example your more paranoid, anxious and you overthink, which can lead too deppresion and mental illnesses. i hope this was helpful too sum up why we need some form of middle-ground. &lt;3
the message is awesome, but this is a overgeneralization of what therapy is.
a video should be made to help people know when therapy is needed or not
makes sense üôÇ
you are awesome and so is this video! explains a lot - being almost 60 i know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about but didn‚Äôt know it had a name! damn
this video format is not it...
i can&#39;t comperhend how precise and true this lecture was. it&#39;s like i&#39;m aware of the self awareness issue, and it seem like my own overthinking have come to the conclusion that it has to sacrifice itself and this is like an articulation of that idea.<br><br>i&#39;ve been watching marc manson from this he started this channel, and i&#39;ve never giving him any attention. as i say he&#39;s just a good author with a great book, and all he&#39;s doing is just trying to gain the most of validation of his great single achievement.<br><br>but seeing the profound ideas being laid out with this amazing simplify clips and illustrations, it shows how mark&#39;s solution to the modern intellectual problems is the antidote do the suffering associated with self-consciousness.<br><br>or maybe i&#39;m just overthinking it, and this was just a great video!<br><br> thanks mark.
too late mark. i already learnt this the hard way. but thank you, your content always enhances my perspective.
that fucking couch motherf, almost killed me.
this is why bitches online who are like &quot;men would rather <i>____</i> than go to therapy&quot; are pretty much nimwits. first of all, not all therapy is the same. secondly, not all therapists are good. third, not everyone needs therapy. but you know who benefits from all these therapy trends? therapists and that scam company better help.
i&#39;m from the philippines and i am very thankful, that you bring the discussion of too much self-awarness because i&#39;m feeling less of the purpose of my life. i think  that all life is difficult and  there&#39;s no room for me to  do what makes me happy. so i try all ways to fix all my problems but i create some delusional problems thus  i should be careful  of it.
this is so important to hear. i do struggle to process it a little though, as someone who probably would have committed suicide by now if not for both good therapists and psychiatric pills. i moved from one extreme to the other, similar to what you described is happening to the younger generations. until age 19 i lived a life with very little understanding of my emotions and needs, and suffered lots of abuse. then from age 20 to now, at 24 - i spent way too much time overthinking every single little thing in my life and obsessively analysing it, that in many situations made me take better routes in my life (realising i was raped and taking space from that person for starters) but also caused me a lot of waste of powers and exhaustion in my every day life, being unable to focus on productive actions or thinking i&#39;m being productive and overworking a ton but not in an efficient manner. when i&#39;m at my worst, i do need the support, i need to think things through to figure out what caused my state and how to process and heal from it. once i&#39;m better though, at least for however long it lasts, i learn how to focus on productivity, relationships and try my best not to overthink and analyse things, only when something is of a very large significance. i live with severe ocd which is the 7th most disabling common illness in the world (of all illnesses, not just the mental ones). and actually, my therapist is doing exactly what you&#39;re suggesting - teaching me to not think things through too much, not stress when not necessary, not seek reasoning for every emotion and so forth, that&#39;s been pretty effective.
me likey
wonderful how mark speaks like us common people only with substantiating it with facts and datas and common sense...this is why many people like me can relate to him...i hope he reaches to more people in the coming times
developing self-awareness is a practice of deepening the relationship with yourself. the point of it is an expansion of my self-connection, not a problem solving tool. it sounds to me you‚Äôre mostly seeing it as a problem solving tool and so your own advice to not overdo it applies. to me, that‚Äôs not what self-awareness is. the biggest plane for developing self-awareness for me is my body and my body‚Äôs sensations, none of the modalities you mentioned have that as a focus - they all have cognition as a focus, which again brings self awareness back to being a problem solving device. in practices like meditation or somatic experiencing or other trauma therapy modalities you can forever practice self-awareness, because it ever increases the plane of your perception and your body‚Äôs sensate world. in harsher words, the way you use self awareness as a term isn‚Äôt what it really means.
too much self awareness can lead to someone justifying their behavior. oh, it‚Äôs my irish ancestry, so can‚Äôt help but share my depression with you and ruin your day. i‚Äôm neurodivergent, so excuse me for behaving in a way that i know isn‚Äôt neurotypical <br><br>knowing is half the battle, the beginning of the other half of that battle is using that information to improve
great videoüéâ i think if you are going through common struggles like a heart break, lost a job, etc.. then talking to a friend or journaling is probably the most effective way and financial way to solve your problem but therapy is more than just talking. a therapist can help you restructure your cognitive function like for those who suffer with ptsd, ocd and  rumination syndrome for example. therapy can help change the way the brain takes in information and changes the way that information gets processed. also you could be dealing with psychological issues and not know why. for example if someone is anxious all the time and doesn‚Äôt know why then maybe it‚Äôs something to do with their past so talking to a therapist helps them find out what that thing is. you could have developed a fear of abandonment or a fear of rejection which can really impact your life if you‚Äôre not aware of it so talking to a therapist can uncover those issues that might be buried in the subconscious mind, also trauma is another one that doesn‚Äôt have to be a big event that happened to you but can have big psychological issues that might need more than just a friend or journal to help relieve yourself from it
this is such an important video! i hope many people see it. the pathologization of normal behavior/thoughts/feeling also applies to diagnoses like autism or adhd. everytime someone posts a relatable video about for example losing your stuff, procrastination, wanting to be alone and so on, there are soooo many comments saying that this is adhd/autism. it seems like every little thing that is not perfectly organized, super, perfect, social, planned and perfectly adapted is given a diagnosis. anyone who is over-pathologizing themselves needs to get off mental-health social media, watch a stupid show, allow their humor and silliness to come back, and chill a little bit. and i say that as a psychology student.
dont even have to watch it : its called &#39; paranoia &#39;
selflessness is the real way...
imma watch when it‚Äôs had the same thumbnail for 24 hours.
hmmm, this episode sounds like a book sales pitch. i‚Äôd like to see a debate on this subject.
hmm so the sponsor of previous videos is better help, a therapy serivce, then on a video dissing threapy and promoting journaling, the journaling software is the sponsor....
great advice as per usual and loved the hilarious parts thrown in. mark as a therapist and throwing down on a birdhouse - 100% recommend
as someone with a personality disorder, i can tell you that a few years in therapy doesn&#39;t do the job. if you have learnt to disconnect from your body, to dissociate, it&#39;s not easy to reverse the process, and journaling will not fix you. i get your overall message, perhaps it&#39;s true for the majority of people, but sadly not everyone.
ignorance is bliss?
this is an ‚Äúuntethered soul‚Äù recap too, great info
when you have no physical suffering and no problems to solve in order to survive, the mind creates its own problems.
great work
self awareness is definitely a big problem when it&#39;s high
so i&#39;m reading that the take away here is we need to visualize a sandwich as an amazing dinner. got it thanks.
let me rephrase it: the ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù of bad state like fear, anger etc is only a blank message. <br>the individual decides how to interpret it. <br><br>growth mindset on huberman explains that well.
please consider more long format videos and less ling format tiktoks üòÇ<br><br>too much jumping around and memes. i‚Äôm not a teenager üòÇ<br><br><br>great content, thank you for your hard work.
this is generally speaking to the more affluent with day-to-day problems, not severe trauma, or i hope so.
quality content. üî•üòâ
mark you look awesome today!
i think most therapy is garbage. 90% is just having a seperate 3rd party to talk to.
i love this‚Ä¶ there is so much evidence from what i‚Äôve seen that focusing on your problems actually makes them bigger. it‚Äôs why i have to be careful about journaling actually, because if i do it too much or in a certain way, i get sorta depressed. the best things you can do are develop friendships, get a hobby, eat/sleep/workout‚Ä¶. and stop complaining all the time. haha. it‚Äôs really that simple.
my view is self-awareness is like telling everyone how happy you are. the more of it you claim to have it the less you actually do. that being said i loved therapy. as einstein said, &quot;you cannot solve a problem with the same mind that created it.&quot; at least not alone. the idea self-awareness can solve problems on it&#39;s own is absurd.  being aware you have an issue merely let&#39;s you know what it is. not what to do about it. you need an exterior force to enact that change. that is what therapy is for. i think people now use therapy to just dump on their therapist but they do not want to do anything about it. they think therapy is like a confession. it is not. it is about digging, if you are not willing to find out why, you will never resolve it. how are you supposed to get over rape if you refuse to discuss the incident?  i feel like you are starting to lose people like me that use you as a reflection. you seem to now be over thinking shit you would normally mock just for content. you are starting to become like all these other content creators. the quality is dropping dude.
if we all had enough money to live..most therapy would be unnecessary
anything that is focused on in excess is harmful, as are many things that are not focused on enough. like almost everything in life, balance is key. easier said than done though. this is where trial and error come in to figure out what that balance is for us, for it is different from every individual.
as someone who grew up in a traumatic environment, i have to respectfully, but wholeheartedly disagree with this video, on multiple levels.<br><br> first, when it fomes to the studies looking at which forms of therapy are the most successful, the reality is that success in therapy is deeply subjective, and completely dependent upon the individual undergoing therapy. what one person may deem successful, another person may not deem successful at all. this therefore calls into question the validity of these studies, given that it&#39;s therefore impossible to have objective criteria with which to evaluate how successful a particular form of therapy is.  these studies beg the question: successful by whose standards? <br><br>secondly, when your ability to see yourself in ways that are both objective and healthy has been distorted by traumatic experiences, tools such as journaling and even talking to friends fall completely short of talking to an experienced, liscensed professional. such tools can, in fact, even be damaging, because they can serve to reinforce the very traumatic beliefs that are harming you in the first place. journaling will only serve to reinforce the negative views you have about yourself and the world around you, because you have no one with which to talk to to provide a healthy perspective. when your own perspective about yourself is so deeply unhealthy because it has been negatively damaged as a result of trauma, journaling will fail to provide the necessary healthy, objective perspective that&#39;s required, because you don&#39;t have that healthy perspective to begin with. the very objectivity spoken of in this video therefore becomes impossible to obtain, because all of your thoughts will be colored by your trauma, thus damaging and limiting your perspective. i say this from both personal experience, and the experiences of others i know who have been through trauma as well. journaling can thetefore only help you so much, and certainly is by no means a substitute for talking to a liscensed professional. <br><br>talking to friends, or simply a &quot;thoughtful individual,&quot; while potentially helpful, can also instead be damaging if, in fact, the person you&#39;re talking to, due to problematic beliefs of their own, instead reinforces the very negative thoughts that are holding you back from true healing, thus making the problem worse. i in fact had exactly this happen when working with a psychology intern, thinking that a &quot;caring individual,&quot; was all i needed for therapy. she actually wound up triggering a ptsd flashback in me by blurring boundaries and pushing me in ways that were highly inappropriate. having a trained therapist truly makes a massive difference for this very reason. after what i experienced, i will never make the mistake of thinking that all i need is a &quot;listening ear,&quot; like this video claims, ever again. <br><br>a therapist, however--especially one who is trained in trauma informed care--has been trained to understand the effcets that trauma has on the individual, how to recognize the patterns borne of trauma in an individual, and both how the negative thought patterns that arise from trauma are holding a person back, as well as how to heal them. they are then able to provide both insight into how trauma is effecting the individual, and are trained in knowing how to help the individual overcome the effects that trauma has had upon them. all of this leads to profound healing that neither journaling or simply a &quot;listening ear,&quot; can ever take the place of. <br><br>plus, these days, a good therapist will tell you when they feel you&#39;re healed enough to move on from therapy in order to avoid the pitfall of your looking for issues that aren&#39;t there, which this video mentions as being problematic within therapy. i&#39;ve had plenty of therapists who have told me that the time had come for me to leave therapy, thus eliminating this issue altogether. for all of these reasons, therapy is most certainly superior to both journaling and simply talking to a &quot;caring individual.&quot; both can certainly have their place. when it comes to receiving real help, however, nothing can take the place of talking to a trained professional. <br><br>to be honest, i was really shocked to hear the claim made that journaling can actually be more helpful than therapy. such an outlandish claim really came across to me as a disingenuous attempt  to promote his sponsor, rather than actually help. for this reason, i&#39;m unsubscribing.
so you can pay someone to just sympathize with you? get some friends and enjoy the process. actually writing your journal, with real pen and paper, is part of the process.
now i feel like i am self aware of the fact that i am self aware and now i am more self ware to stop that self awareness
this is fucking fire oh my god!!!!
good job mark! a lot effort and it deserve 1 likeüòÇüéâ
this is the best channels i have ever found, and i know them all.<br><br>from now on i will only listen to you.
i knew it.
this happened to me from too much therapy. it&#39;s true
i always enjoy and ponder the perspectives you provide. however, as a marriage and family therapist, this leaves a lot out with regard to therapy. <br>- therapy (with a good therapist) is very different than speaking with a &quot;thoughtful amateur&quot; bc generally the amateur will have less objectivity and multiple roles (having to maintain whatever other relationship they have with the person sharing).<br>-  a client generally does come to therapy with some identifiable challenge<br>-  good therapist doesn&#39;t expect to see a client who has resolved that challenge. in other words, we don&#39;t dredge up stuff for the sake of finding stuff to manage in therapy. a good, ethical therapist meets the client where they are in that moment and discontinues therapy when the challenge is manageable. <br>- it should be mentioned that there can be a detrimental way to journal - especially if there is no thoughtful processing going on. i hope the product you were selling provides clear guidance on the entire process of meaningful journaling<br>*i have been a client of the same therapist for 25+ years - i saw them initially when i was going through a major life transition. at that time, speaking with my sister, the thoughtful amateur, was indeed comforting and provided support. however, she was unable to provide the feedback that challenged areas where i was engaging in not-so-healthy thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, because of unconsciously needing to maintain our otherwise positive sibling dynamic. she may have validated (thus normalized) feelings that were actually problematic and not useful. on a side note, the last time i had a session with my therapist was about four years ago when i experienced another challenging transition- had four meaningful sessions which brought me back to &quot;baseline.&quot; the expectation from my therapist is never to continually need or want for me to see them for session. and simply knowing they are there in case i need them, is often all i need to continue to move forward, adapt, or sit in the moment and be able to use my self-awareness to oftentimes not give a fuck and be okay....<br><br>there&#39;s a ton more to say and the bottom line is that a good therapist can be one of your invaluable tools...
i don&#39;t journal...but i write songs and poems.  same result
i love your content mark, i was wondering if you had any references to the studies showing that all forms of therapy are about equal and that journaling is just as effective? was curious if it was a meta-analysis done or just the methodology overall. appreciate your vids!!
this video deserves 100m views. short, clear and actionable. great advice mark
&quot;journaling better than therapy&quot;? are you serious? can you support this with studies? all therapies produce same results? talking to someone more important than method? worst sh$t i have ever heard from you. dissapointing. i have been a proponent of yours for a long time, but you have stepped into a field which it is clear that you do not have a clue or understanding about. there is science related to therapy, there is trauma therapy with special techniques, it is a huge domain of knowledge and practice and trying to ridicule these is way out of line. spend some time, actually a couple of years, to study the field and you may see how wrong you are. man, you really disappointed me this time. oversimplifying so much complicate matters and making so many false assumptions and statements is a recipe for making many people even more stupid. i hope to see you taking down this video, but i doubt you will since it is clear you use these unsupported claims to promote products so it is not just ignorance, it is plain marketing. and probably you don&#39;t give a f@ck about about negative comments and losing proponents.
this was fucking awesome<br><br>you saved my life <br><br>thank you
this video started off good but took a wrong turn about halfway. people are largely unconscious. people come into therapy and lead with what they know, but it‚Äôs just the surface of what drives them underneath. when people inevitably don‚Äôt know what to talk about, it is often because they ran out of material in their conscious awareness. if they can be guided deeper into their unconscious by a licensed therapist (not a influencer guru) who is trained in knowing how to navigate this, they can expand awareness more and reorganize the meanings initially made about themselves and others retrospectively, getting closure on the past, a sense of continuity to the present, and a more educated stance on how to move forward. while i think it‚Äôs great more people are interested in therapy, you and a lot of other influencers get a lot wrong about what actually happens in treatment. much of the information i see you and others pass off is diluted, skewed, or very specific to certain scenarios. my concern though is when it&#39;s passed off as the authoritative truth about therapy and mental health disorders... and you are not a therapist. this creates a lot of misinformation and false expectations about treatment in the public, from someone who is not a licensed therapist. to be fair, you have some really good information (e.g. the studies you included), but in every one of your new therapy videos i‚Äôve seen, all get at least a little bit wrong but the conclusions/impressions you make from these errors are huge and misguided. please consider using disclaimers, and leave more of therapy to those who are properly licensed to speak about it without misinformation.
the first step is get over yourself. until you recognize your own intentional and inadvertent potential for evil you are going nowhere. i remind my kid ‚Äújust going thru your life and making what are, to you, ordinary decisions and actions have the potential to totally fuck over someone else‚Äù just be mindful of that reality when you think you are, by default, a really good person.
i was all my friends‚Äô free therapist for several years and it was exhausting. when i reached burnout, i had to learn to say no so as to protect my time and energy. this led to resentment on their part. please don‚Äôt use your friends for free therapy. if you do, just remember that your friend is doing you a favor. don‚Äôt take them for granted and please respect their boundaries
this is a parody of what therapy is actually about.
sometimes it&#39;s very difficult to understand which problem we have. i can remember that i was confused about fear, anxiety and worrying. after that it was looking for the cause, one day it was adjustment issues to my current life circumstances and the gap between my expectations and the reality, the other day was finding meaning in the new reality, also looking back into the childhood to see what made me expect things i was missing... and these are all the tip of the iceberg! i&#39;m sure that only a few therapists would be able to guide me through all these, which i never met! i never needed somebody who just listens and shows (fake) empathy and charges me for that! i really needed wisdom which i couldn&#39;t get from a therapist or self-help celebrity who is younger than me and had an easy life so far!
i think journaling can be narcissistic. i remember when oprah pushed it ages ago. i hated the idea of it. still kinda do. and i don‚Äôt like her either lol. not everyone needs to chronicle every freaking detail. but maybe i detest it bc i‚Äôm an over-thinker and hypercritical of myself. i‚Äôve modified journaling in a way to be productive for myself. i make notes of things that i ruminate about like a sticky note. i revisit the issue later on when my emotions are more regulated which can help me be more objective. but that‚Äôs me. there‚Äôs no one size fits all, but as mark states these strategies work best when applied in a modest and goal oriented manner. same goes for therapy or talking with others. therapists can be very helpful but they can also cause more problems than solve. marks critique is spot on. loving this stuff, it‚Äôs informative, illuminating, and socially progressive
you should take this video down.. replace therapy with a journaling software you are selling.. come on mark.
mark, while i&#39;m a fan, you really lost me with this video.<br>i get your point that sometimes therapy and self-awareness can go too far. but, consider:<br>1. if a person is has clinical depression, giving advice like &quot;just stop giving a f and read my book&quot; - is not very helpful (to put it mildly).<br>2. or if a person had actual traumatic experience as a child, then such things are best unpacked with a professional therapist, rather than going meditating, journaling, being more physically active, etc.<br>i think if you included this kind of disclamer in your video, it would&#39;ve made much more sense. gotta show both sides of the coin to sound convincing.<br>otherwise, it&#39;s just dangerous advice in my opinion. someone with an actual problem will watch this and decide to not go seek professional help. i&#39;ve been in that boat - just convincing myself that i need to sleep better, or excersise more, or eat healthier or read another book. while in reality i was just procrastinating going to therapy - which in the end was the best money i&#39;ve ever spent. therapy is getting bad rep recently, and while i&#39;m sure there are problems in that industry, gotta separate that from the tremendous benefits that it gives (most of the time).<br>*not a usual chatter, so sorry for a long essay.
such a refreshing short n engaging crash course. and the outro and the plug was on point too! sleek transition from an author to a showman presenter! lol
haha the couch
modern society is no danger whatsoever of being overrun with self awareness. it&#39;s a brave new world after all.
the editing on this is amazing, shoutout to whoever edited it, haven&#39;t been impressed by a video in a while
that coach though ;)
this video is so good! keep up the work man, it helped me a lot, you can&#39;t even imagine! how do you even do all this great stuff, you do make wonders.
production value on the rise üëè
very helpful. eye opener
important to distinguish self-awareness from, for example, mind-awareness - which includes personalities-awareness / ego-awareness.<br><br>the self is not the mind (not the thoughts, not the feelings/emotions)<br><br>being &quot;aware&quot; of one&#39;s thoughts &amp; feelings/emotions is not self-awareness
it&#39;s not always this easy to change something in your life and to know when you don&#39;t actually need to change. even when you journaling there are bad days that you don&#39;t wanna o don&#39;t know what to write but turns out that simetimes these days are dense with usefull info. these topic needs time to be dealt with. <br>assuming that there are an all time high of mental health problems and it is only linked with too much self awarness is not correct. <br>i don&#39;t see any correlation to these to statistics, in fact its possible that the increased self help industry matches the needs of these tyes of help in these difficult times.<br>please don&#39;t generalize these things because its not these simple to point out the cause of these problem.
haha! the picture of the couchüòÇüòÇüòÇ
a wonderful message. :-)<br><br>that&#39;s exactly what happened to me: at some point in my life, not everything was great, but i was actually doing well.<br><br>and since then i don&#39;t have to undergo any therapy at all. i just have to accept my own peculiarities as well as those of other people.<br><br>i am healthy enough to now ‚Äújust‚Äù develop my emotional and character maturity. step by step. and full of curiosity.<br><br><b><i>i wish you all this beautiful feeling of being okay - especially with your fears and your anger, with your mistakes and weaknesses. with everything that is there!</i></b> ‚ù§üçÄü§ó

this is definitely a recent and relevant topic
looking good mark!
just sounds like confessional booths at church.
this was great
it might not be like that for everyone but it really shouldn&#39;t be called &quot;mental health&quot; but &quot;emotional health&quot; if anything.<br><br>why? <br><br>because the mind; the beliefs, the stories, the self-criticism, etc, are all just mental strategies or defenses &quot;protecting&quot; me from feeling.<br><br>i don&#39;t feel safe to feel hence i suffer. <br><br>it&#39;s not the pain of feeling that makes me suffer, it&#39;s not being able to feel it. it&#39;s the resistance to feeling that hurts. <br><br>once i can feel and cry i feel great regardless of what the sensation because i feel accepted by myself and because there&#39;s movement (think of being bloated or constipated and what a relief it is when it finally moves) but if my mind tries to avoid it by going to either extreme it lacks the nuance necessary to actually feel. <br><br>and i believe the models we developed try to analyze the symptoms the mind creates to defend itself from the body because the mind has it&#39;s clear although often delusional structures it likes to lean on and hold on to while emotions are not clear-cut like that.<br><br>but that&#39;s my view, as a very emotional and sensitive guy and we&#39;re not all wired the same.<br><br>&quot;mental&quot; is the symptom of the &quot;emotional&quot;. <br><br>sure the brain may be the commander but the battlefield is still somatic and the pain isn&#39;t imagined. <br><br>the wounds still need proper care to heal or else we&#39;re so full of pain and ways to avoid it the world we live in ceases to be real.
yes, of course people can benefit from considerate amateurs - but if the people who pay attention to you and who are willing to be your dumpster for your feelings and worries, they shouldn&#39;t know how not to abuse you by themselves feel great because they are necessary to you and make you feel small because you need their help?<br>so if you do this with a layperson, the risk of being harmed is much higher and you don&#39;t even know it. we all know the arrogance of priests, doctors and teachers who felt superior and traumatized you. most people who do this for free have helper syndrome. yes, even psychotherapists have it - but they get the chance to figure it out during their training, so many of them are aware of their responsibilities and know how not to harm their clients.<br>there is a study in austria that found that really good therapists of each method are more similar to each other than therapists from the same school. so ‚Äì yes, being good at this job is also a talent! like really good teachers, priests, doctors. why shouldn&#39;t they be paid for their services? and paying them also prevents clients from feeling bad about abusing a person for their own problems... (unless you&#39;re a narcissist ;-) then you don&#39;t feel guilty about abusing people for your own needs. )
go with the flow, you know what&#39;s right for you!
i agree with a lot of this, but i think you&#39;re jabbing a bit too hard at the benefit of therapy on the whole. <br><br>responsible therapists spend a lot of time, both during licensing and then on-the-job, diagnosing mental health issues and developing expertise on the human condition. they see patterns in cognition that their patients don&#39;t, and they can help guide people to healthy solutions that break cycles of self-sabotage or defense mechanisms that no longer make sense.<br><br>can people accomplish the same thing with journaling, or chatting with a good friend? possibly. it depends on whether the person is candid and dedicated enough to get good observations, determine the real issue(s) from those observations, and then make lifestyle changes to address the issue(s). depending on the issue(s) at play, that&#39;s a lot of ground to expect someone with no expertise on the subject of mental health, or often even themselves, to cover alone.
this mf is good.
couldn&#39;t agree more. i&#39;ve journalled for the last 3 years and it has made an enormous difference. when i feel content, i don&#39;t journal at all. whenever i feel down, i get the paper and pen out.
was anybody aware of the picture of the black couch that mark used in this video?
mark, keep his content still high quality
now that&#39;s look like some real shit ....woww man.... appreciate it.
journaling is effective? then according to mine i am better off dead and have no hope. not joking. that&#39;s is why i stopped doing it.
firstly, i must say this video came at the perfect time in my life, more importantly is i absolutely love the production quality on this video, i still remember when you made the announcement that you were trying something new on the channel and i have been loving the content since then, the improvements are very visible
try putting god above yourself.  try loving others as yourself, which means spending as much time thinking about others and doing for others at least as much as yourself without an agenda to receive something in return.  try loving your enemies.<br><br>the solution that works was figured out long ago and it involves realizing that you are not that important and not the center of the universe.
i love this deep awareness being spoken aloud, perhaps for the first time, that the practice of normalizing what is pathological - think alternate facts, fake news, etc - and pathologizing what is normal - ie difficult emotions - is a huge contributor to disrupting mental health.the remedies offered sound great too. awesome teaching, mark!!
act (acceptance and commitment therapy, or better acceptance and commitment training) is for me a life changer, not as a therapy method but as a way of living. if you are struggling with yourself and/or with life, i can highly recommend to investigate act. besides the subtitle art of not giving a fuck (witch has a lot of act similarities) one of my favorite books is the happiness trap by russ harris! it really changed my life for the better!
i&#39;ve always intuited what mark says here as truth, that if we have a friend to talk to, they serve the same role as a therapist - except, hopefully they do out of actual care, rather than paying someone who only cares to be paid. i know we don&#39;t always have access to such a friend. in those cases, i&#39;ve also found journalling serves as a way to air my thoughts and feelings, and by reading through the journal entries at a later date, it immensely help to appreciate what i&#39;ve been through and gives me a reflection about where i was in relation to where i am now - hence, integration, the goal of therapy. thanks, mark, you&#39;re serving as a spokeman for the public good!!!
nice day one ad ü§°
i guess this parallels with the accusations of dsm-5 pathologizing the normal?
the couchüòÇ
and bro promoted betterhelp.
self-awareness is the most misunderstood concept that has been thrown around , the goal is not to become self-aware and just stop there , the goal is to use self-awareness to fix some of your flaws so that you stop fucking up your life unnecessarily ..
i agree with your points about telling the difference between generally normal experiences and what may need more tending to, and i believe self-awareness alone does not lead to change. it must be paired with self-accountability and action too. a good therapist is actually there to guide you through all that and isn&#39;t afraid of tough love and calling out a behavior pattern (once trust has been built). also, a good therapist recognizes when it&#39;s time to suggest a client graduate from therapy to go at things on their own relying on the social support they&#39;ve hopefully built.
i think the previous thumbnail was better
therapy has helped me, but i guess it could depend on how deep your problems are. i am positive that i could not have made as much progress as i have just by journaling.
the production quality of the video though ü§å
these videos help so much thanks mark
yeah this kind of the reason why i just finished my therapy.<br><br>i mean yeah, i still have to solve some things to improve my diet, but i can work in that by myself
take out of this vid<br>1. emotion is natural and rather simple feedback, and we dont necessary to take the feedbacl<br>2.dont fix whats not broken- dont look for problems and creating more small problems<br>3. physical activity
i talk to my best friend about all my problems. she is really smart and it helps me a lot. i went to a therapist once and had a bad experrience. i would rather talk to my friends.
wow! how insightful! nice one, mark.
love and accept yourself.  problem solved.
i read both of your books, sadly my sister appropriated the first one, then i moved out the city and she never returned it back to me üòÖ i watch your videos and oh god i want to read it back all over again.
started journaling in my early teens many years before therapy was accessible in ths social milieu. 30 years and several therapists later, my journal still proves to be most vital tool in my mental health and self awareness tool box.<br>consistency is key
we went from having basically negative self care in the whole western version of stoicism to overshooting in the other direction.<br>i do think it will settle in a more healthy space even if that will likely take a few generations. that said and to be fair to the current situation it&#39;s not great especially in the english speaking world where we are constantly under pressure by a high cost of living and poor job security and of course the constant fear and warmongering that takes place. turns out when your country builds its wealth and power on exploitation of others and you add the internet to this a lot of people are going to be disillusioned by the story they where told as children.
diets are a lot like this too, just the act of paying attention to what you eat will do more than carnivore vs vegan. <br><br>the worst part is that people will try 5 kinda of therapy or 5 different diets, then the 6th one works and they become dogmatic about them. even if it might be they learned to get better at them over time and they just hit a good stride during that 6th. i see people doing this with philosophies, religions, world views. the one they happened to be doing during a big epiphany then gets miss associated with something else they were doing at that time.<br><br>not saying i&#39;m immune to any of this, just felt like sharing.
mark i have gaming addictions and just watching video.
mind blowing!
you know you&#39;re too self-aware when everything is going fine then all of a sudden anxiety is like &quot;i just caught you in 4k thinking things are normal. didn&#39;t think i&#39;d catch you trying to mindlessly meta a social interaction?&quot;<br><br>then the cycle starts. your now  being anxious about your anxiety catching you again.
who wants more of mr. manson and a black board? like here
that‚Äôs a nice couch
2057 and this is the best vid on the internet thus far.... mark forever legendary
im too aware of the smells, the colors, the imperfections, the sounds, ughh
heeey, that couch looks familiar....where have i seen that before?
&quot;ignorance is bliss
loved the new setup for the video üòä
damn mark this video was an epiphany! thank you! üôè
so, basically, its not so much about having too much self-awarenes as it is about the pressure to always be perfect or &quot;correct&quot; in thoughts and actions. high self-awareness can be beneficial as it helps you understand your thoughts, emotions, and behaviors better. the key is to pair this awareness with acceptance, allowing yourself to experience thoughts and emotions without harsh judgment or the need to be perfect. thanks, mark!
so.... mr. mark manson, you get some credit here. i have been using &quot;day one&quot; on my ipad for about three months now, but have not yet pulled the trigger on going premium. after watching this, and reading &quot;the subtle art of not giving a fuck,&quot; &quot;everything is fucked,&quot; and being a jungian, i will today spend the $34.99/year to go &#39;premium&#39; and have the ability to yell, swear, video idiots, and sulk to my ipad! thanks mark! üòÜ
i&#39;m a simple man, i see mark&#39;s new video, i smash that like butt on

the great &#39;disruptor&#39; is here guys.
can false memory syndrome happen with journaling and meditation as well???
too much self awareness will make you a crybaby
what about doing too much meditation?
sources in description maybe?
as we all collect more and more mental health diagnoses, seems like maybe a lot of these are just normal variations.
this video came handy today, thank you mark
how can i recognize when i have too much self-awareness?
we really want our emotions to be validated by others ....
oh, man... very good video. thank you.
i like the self awareness analogy at the start it can be something really important to have just right<br><br>(also congrats mark on the 2 mil but i guess you don&#39;t give a duck)
i just slid right through the floor of his basement and there was a short sensation of falling and then there was a sensation of falling up and i fell up into a person. i found myself on the deck of this little water skiing boat. coughing up water and there were a bunch of guys surrounding me on the deck of this water ski boat who were trying to sit me up and pounding my back and saying man we thought you drowned. but i didn&#39;t know any of them. i was suddenly outside. it was warm. it wasn&#39;t christmas anymore. i was just looking around and amazed at how real everything was. i mean it was as real as this. the water was wet. i didn&#39;t know any of these guys but they all seemed to know me and they thought that i&#39;d been water skiing and that i was this different person and i just start laughing and telling all these guys that none of this is real and that i&#39;m having a salvia trip.
over a million videos saying i&#39;m autistic when i&#39;m not is pretty awesome.
i‚Äôm very much aware of how self aware i am!!!
if you are lying in bed sound asleep, you can dream up a hallucinated alien chasing your hallucinated body while you fight it off with a hallucinated machine gun which can puncture its hallucinated skin resulting it a hallucinated victory and even a hallucinated feeling of joy. so in a dream ‚Äî precisely because everything is a hallucination ‚Äî a hallucinated weapon is very useful. without it, you might get eaten alive!<br><br>now, what if what you call ‚Äúreality‚Äù works just like that?<br><br>if you‚Äôre like the typical person, you hold hallucination as a category of experience which is separate from ordinary ‚Äúreal‚Äù experience. to you, hallucinations are clearly unreal and inferior to real perceptions. but now i want you to consider the radical possibility that everything is a hallucination! consider that there are not two categories of experience, one ‚Äúreal‚Äù and one ‚Äúhallucinatory‚Äù, but only one category: hallucination. you might wonder, why call this one category hallucination instead of perception?‚Äù because hallucination is closer to the fact. hallucination is defined as perception without an object. which is exactly what we‚Äôve got!¬†<br><br>perception = hallucination! there is nothing else behind it! there is no physical, external world behind your everyday perceptions. which literally means that what you think of as solid, tangible, physical, material reality is just a hallucination, albeit a rather persistent one ‚Äî one which is shared by most of the people in your tribe. that is, until you start to play around with altered states of consciousness or psychedelics. then you quickly realize how intangible, unreal, and hallucinatory your everyday experience was all along. this is exactly why psychedelics are so effective. and also exactly why they are so demonized by mainstream culture.üòä
ignorance is bliss‚Ä¶especially when you‚Äôre ignorant about yourself.
there is no &quot;self&quot;. i&#39;m just a body (and it&#39;s needs) and a ghost in the machine that&#39;s aware of sh*t.
yes. so what?
love you. you books really helped me back in the day and just last week i bought one for my sister! wish you all the best

part of the problem is without talking to somebody. how do we know where actually improving and not just improving our perception of ourselves.
