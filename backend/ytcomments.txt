that beat is 🔥
oooooweeee😁
y&#39;all being this butt hurt over this is hilarious.🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
snoops best verse in years
“freestyle “ remember when that meant off the top?
shit is trash
this is terrible
this mf drake said &quot;u better have a mf quintuple entendra on that shit, some shit i don&#39;t even understand&quot; i swear i almost cried when he said that🤣
what  fuck  <a href="uckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv-11ujg/ygf1xpgummjk8gsdri2wcx"></a><a href="uckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv-11ujg/ygf1xpgummjk8gsdri2wcx"></a> <a href="uckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv-11ujg/ygf1xpgummjk8gsdri2wcx"></a><a href="uckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv-11ujg/ygf1xpgummjk8gsdri2wcx"></a>!!!
kendrick we need you!!! lmao
people getting worked up about this is what he wants...
using pac voice for some weak ass beef is a bitch move
man i miss 2pac
don&#39;t use tupac voice in this cup cake ish naw makaveli 4 eva
grammy award for biggest troll
kendrick: got the real snoop on his album in 2015<br><br>drake: uses ai to create a fake snoop verse and rather makes tracks with sexyy red..<br><br>yeah the certified lover boiii.. he&#39;s such a clown
nah this wasnt it
drake about to get sued or fucked up by snoop right now and possibly pac&#39;s affiliates and friends. he is playing with fire now
this shit corny as fuck.
“in a note pad doing lyrical gymnastics my boy 🤸‍♀️ you better have a muthafuckin quintuple entendre some shit i don’t even understand” 😭😭
everything is ai generated today until you see it on the artists channel. am i reaching
the &quot;nah, nah, nah&quot; part has been my highlight of this record
this beat go harder with each listen 😭
this what we needed in hip hop, the back n forth and im here for it (the idols is crazy tho)😂😂
hey drake ghost writers. you did a great job on the first diss response. you completely undone all that great work in this shitty disrespectful tune here.<br>drake, leave pac to rest in peace.
kendrick really gonna have ptsd after this one
genius
dont say u could battle if u dont even write ur songs, fuck rappers who use ghostwriters
bruh what am i listening to 🤣🤣
kendrick is about to flame drake like dumbfoumdead did to conceded i can feel it coming. 📝
drake fans are truly delusional, talking about how many songs he put out in 2 weeks, like the mf wrote them 😂😂 using ai cuz no one tryna jump in this pain train he’s ridin. weakest shit he done yet.
yall boys quiet for the weekend might go over yall head
“i never cried when pac died<br>but i probably will when hov does”
wack as fuck
this is so fire 🔥 genius move
never getting bored of this
the end of the era 🎉😢 but it’s guns blazing
he ja ruled himself dog!
using a.i tupac is embarrassing
if this is real, he just hug himself. ai tupac.... are you joking me?
tf is this??? wack ass hell pac never rapped like that… not his cadence and the beat is terrible
ai rapping exactly like drake, but it sounds like a shitty version of pac. sounds like snoop with a drake flow 🤣. hilarious.<br>won&#39;t lie, tho, song bangs, lol
i&#39;m actually angry at this fucker using pac&#39;s voice. i hope drake gets cancelled for this shit
drake wrote snoop and pac’s hardest verses 🤣
yep, it seems all the other rappers, need to &#39;find a blackberry with the side scroll&#39;. 😃
a lot of people more than idolize pac like sacred ground. not just the stan base but real ones that could open up a westcoast threat level that could get out of control. it was a bold move, and even if he didn&#39;t write it, some level of props for personally owning up for all the smoke under his name, seen and not seen type shit
that take off reference was nasty “get your head popped in a crowded room “
kendrick getting fucking worked is not what i was expecting lmao
drake voice sounds weird
everyone saying drake took weeks too respond, you gota remember there was so many other rappers coming at him and he beefin with so he hada wait to see all he needed to mop up 🧹
listen to the words &quot;pac&quot; and &quot;snoop&quot; aint dissing dot &quot;they&quot; wanting him to respond
at this point kendrick better respond with a nft….
embarrassing using ai.<br>guy already doesn’t write his own stuff.<br>drake using ghost writers isn’t even controversial.<br>it is known.<br>he is a pop star, that is what they do.<br><br>so it was already hard to take him seriously in a beef/battle.<br>drake is a king of pop. he has a lot of great hits. leave hip hop conversation for the people that write their own shit.
for all the dogs that thought rick ross &quot;won&quot; something...
truth be told drake is the greatest of all time!!!....i aint replying to any comments under this
those last few pac bars “you supposed to be the boogeyman, go do what you do. unless this is a moment that you tell us this not really you. in that case, there’s nothing left to say i just pass it to snoop” seem like a shot at the ending of mortal man on to pimp a butterfly 🦋
drake calling other people corporate industry puppets is hilarious
this fairy screwing up legends
this sounds horrible
strong af...
this is fucking garbage! use goats to get clicks for your garbage ass raps? 🤦‍♂️
man kendricks diss must have hit drake so hard, dude puts out two disstracks without kendrick even responding to the first one 😂<br>that ai shit was ridiculous as f
drake for the w 💪🏾🔥
drake is madara uchiha bring the dead back to life.
alright now that they are all out “like that” was a 10 and the other two were a 7 shit this is a 5 there is a clear obvious winner
gake get pac&#39;s name and voice out your mouth!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬 any rapper or fan that carries pac&#39;s legacy needs to scorched earth this lame ass fake professional karaoke entertainer. i hope he ends up like mgk, sing  pink bubble gum pop, in a crop top! 😂
had to have some fake beefin  happen in the rap scene cus it was so quite the rulers of the music industry must have got bored how rap ain’t rap no more and everybody happy getting money.
dude gone 50 cent mode...... unbelievable.
😂😂😂😂 trash man trash
y’all waited until y’all made middle age to beef
this wacc!!
man, this ai tupac &amp; snoop is something!  i wonder what snoop got to say about that 😅
the drugs that it takes to decide to do this is out of this world
this is the wackess shit i&#39;ve heard in my life
eh 🫤
you know what this really means right?  hip hop is dying.  these are the desperate moves of people who see the loss of their fortunes to ai.  when the music itself doesn&#39;t make enough money you start controversy.  they&#39;re cashing out one last time as much as they can because they&#39;re a business before they&#39;re anything else. all 3 of them.  they see the writing on the wall and they&#39;re milking y&#39;all for as much attention as they can while they still can.
2pac would diss drake 100%
this is hilariously one of the best things tracks i have heard in a long time.
i love how all the kendrick fans just say it’s trash but don’t know why he did this song and i’m not defending drake cause i loved the songs before the drama it’s cause he made better music and better moves then kendrick it’s like why you start a war then don’t respond when’s it’s time to  respond.
ain’t no way he really dropped this shit, y’all funny af 😂
that was a big mistake.
this is disrespectful to hiphop/rap as a whole but most of all tupac, f*ck drake!!!!
he charged up again. this is crazy.<br>kendrick dun took off ham on this right here!    a u t h e n t i c v i e w s    dun took his career off 2 the next level fr fr no cap
drake kicking his feet and giggling while posting this shit
nothing about drakes responses are authentic. you can run kdot down as mucha as u want.. kendrick doing what the goat does .. let you all talks much as shxx as possible then adress it with a one liner . hahahahaha <br>constant replys - desperate expecially using ai <br>no reply - u ain&#39;t shxx
here after listening to brilliant idiots pod
cooked. 🍳
bro the snoop is obviously ai
this that &quot;fear&quot; drake
i believe tupac would dislike drake , drake got pee&#39;d by p diddys homeboy
drake got pac rapping 4real man 🙆🏾‍♂️✨🦍
this is it.
weak
he got bodied
😂 people thought this was hot. this sounds so bad lol.
wtf this lame canadian using pacs voice for? disrespectful to the game he ain’t no king of rap only females go to his shows. i’m done that dislike is mine.
this is so disrespectful to tupac
bro made 2pac and snoop sound trash as fuck wht is this man wtf
man used a a.i tupac to address  his pedo allegations. drake lame and so are his clueless fans hyping this
i knew he was still in cuba
damn...aubrey spittin like he 10 steps ahead 😂
‘’yeah unc that’s the truth’’ had me rolling 😂😂 drake is a man on a mission!
but did drake write it though
at this point somebody need to bring big l back
lmfao. wait wait wait, yall do understand drake couldn’t be the one saying this shit with his own mouth cause then he would be dissing himself. of course he has to raise tupac from the dead along side snoop thru ai. lmfao. this shit is wild. and for everyone digging this wild shit is apart of the problem
why do i like the 2pac part….
this is crazy, stop that man
this shit is hot garbage . i&#39;m starting to think all drake ever did was have ghostwriters and use ai . this ain&#39;t it. go sing make good tracks agsin
snoop was too stoned when he heard this 😂😂
sounds nothing like tupacs flow or voices
yooo!! this is crazy!!
art
pac would have never worked with you . this is a disgrace. can&#39;t believe you would  pull a sucker move like this.
the only problem i have is he won’t let people a.i. drake but he’ll a.i. tupac. this is mad artistic though. this one’s gotta hurt
drake comments in the outro of this makes me think this was all just a made up beef that they&#39;re doing for fun or to sell more records.
this is so disrespectful frfr like wtf the best thing to do is to be silent
the creativity is so 🔥..
the one thing i don&#39;t get from drake&#39;s angle is how he is taunting kendrick about not responding yet? didn&#39;t like that drop in march (one month ago)? now drake (officially) drops his disses only a couple of days ago...i don&#39;t see the logic. if anyone can help me understand that&#39;d be appreciated lol.
wtf is wrong with you? you’re gonna use tupac to joke about your pedophilia? you’re digging up graves and for what? so you can remind everyone that you get so little play that you needed to preorder in those dms? that first shit was fire man and for a second i thought you had this shit but you had to go drake it up. my mistake letting you cook ig go do what you do best and ignore it all until it blows over. for our sake and for the sake of the real icons you wanna drag through the dirt for no fucking reason.
this shit hard
dumb
drake having to use ai for a west coast legend and a rapper that is still alive is so lame lol: snoop would never hop on this clown show
i know why drake did what he did but the pac verse was complete garbage.....the way ai was rapping it was drake with a different voice.  same with the snoop verse.....
jesus christ
ngl it’s good
someone diss mnm so he can come out retired ment
first time we have heard an artist of drake&#39;s caliber use ai technology on their song. whether or not you think the move was in good taste, the snoop voice was really spot on....
they tell me the spirit of makaveli is alive, and the nigga under 5 foot 5 so it’s gotta be you 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
so this man is admitting he has been using ai
drake dropped double mid diss records 🤣🤣
fuck all y’all hyping this up he really used the voice of a deadman to further this beef. drake doesn’t give a fuck about the culture at all
worst pac and snoop verses ever
cuz a rap that does use none of his own beat using everybody&#39;s else plz weak ass drake go get fucc by diddy haha
that wat kind of generation we live in studio 🎙 gangstas
who would have thunk it.
stop waking up this beast!  stop playing with drizzy!  <br>please stop for your own sake!
this like if 2pac and snoop got signed to disney 💀
he his self is an industry puppet. the hypocrisy
&quot;taylor swift is your new top&quot;. 1) his label and 2) taylor the top and kendrick is the bottom. 😂😂😂
i gotta admit i grew a lot of respect for drake what the fuck bro drake a genius
hmmm the best era for hiphop since the 90s woohhh 🔥
fucking genius!  wow!
this shit is 🔥 😂
never thought i&#39;d hear tupac rapping like drake and using his flow, but it&#39;s 2024 and here we are 🤷🏻
😂😂😂😂 west coast and canada
drake is trash
leave pac alone you glorified abused disney sex toy
this the war between drake and kendrick for the 1st place 🥇
this shit sound like garbage lol, pac don’t even sound right
well this is trash
its not on the beat bro hoe can it be a good track
the spirit of machivelli is alive and the nigga under 5’5 it’s gotta be you 😂
2.2 m views ? you got some bread off this upload bro ? lol i see you 🔥🔥🔥
why is everyone ignoring the fact drake says illuminati at the start of the song????
drake don’t put tupac in this shit.
that aint even pac flow tho 😂😂😂
tupac would never respect drake
let’s be clear…..kendrick can’t come back from this 😂😂<br>i know you in that ny apartment strugglin’, i know it..”<br>😂😂😂
this a gimmick.
when tf did snoop die? lol
this one changes the game yet again. never saw this coming. and it&#39;s 💥💥💥
pac, snoop, drake came with 3 switches...😅 answered to the boogie man with 3 wishes...<br>aubrey, drake, drizzy, 3 b*tches... put that hiiipower on the name, 3 digits...<br>smoking on that owlpack, no midgit, for the canadian goose whos &quot;out on the loose&quot; long neck, but how you gon stretch tied in a noose? first person shooter but he is not gonna shoot.....<br>scary a*s white boi, puddins in the proof...
this shhh it fire  fire fire fire ....... i love real hip hop being creative plus witty , and its songs like this that let me know that real hip hop will 4 ever live . this is like master ace&#39;s &quot;me and the biz&quot;, orr when nas rapped about being a gun
this ain&#39;t drake 😡
pac would never have dropped a feature on a drake album 😂😂😂😂 this is the saddest versus ever! fck it!! kendrick should respond with a drake ai dissing drake at this point 😂😂😂 mfs don&#39;t know how to rap just copy &amp; paste
repulsive, dude never cared for the art. so fake.
drake is now 50 cent 🤣😂 bro really trolling him with ai voices 😂🤣 and still beating his ass 💢😂🤣
it&#39;s ai tupac voice with drakes style. could have somewhat emulated pac a bit better in terms of how he raps. this sounds nothing like a pac flow. same with snoop.<br><br>kendrick is on the current losing side of this beef though.
flawless victory 😮‍💨🔥🔥🔥<br>the ghost 👻 of styles 🅿️
this shit is hilarious “kendrick we need ya” 🤣
artificially flavored rap!!! 🤦🏾‍♂️
i’m so tired of this ai rapping…idk who is who! this i’m not it for me…
dude this shit is off the chainnnn 😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
no way he did
katt williams made everyone mad. startoff 2024 😂

bro if this is a diss track. then this man is literally gangstalicious boyfriend in that boondocks show.

if pac ever rapped like that id not be a fan of hip hop ever
drake is too wild for this. lmfao 💀💀💀💀💀
the pac and snoop shit was wack. drake should have just did it on his own stop play with voice ai shit. lame
now i&#39;m confused than a mfer this has to be ai
this is brilliant
drake the 🐐 this shiii so hard
kendrick should hop on this same beat and just cook drake west coast style, show how to rap on a beat like this.
yall really think this is fire? 😂😂😂 drake been trash since his first single.
drizzy man🇧🇷🇵🇹✍🏽
drake needed tupac to tell everyone he&#39;s a pedo. sometimes the disses write themselves.
lol they gonna move the goal post 🥅 again… drake really said they gone make excuses for dot 😂
man this beat is 🔥🔥🔥
i mean damn! don’t bring pac &amp; snoop into it 🤦🏾‍♂️
shit…😂it’s over
im here for the taylor swift lyric 🤭
best response from dot…. no response 😂. drake lame for dat.
that drake taylor made joint is so f&#39;ing clever.  listen to the verses carefully.  he got pac and snoop hyping up kendrick and then he just comes in and takes kendrick&#39;s head off.  genius!
what is this bullshit
loooosse💅💅🤣
bro used the re-animation jutsu
weird af!!!! a big no frm me
ai literally just raps like drake w the vocal cover
wow amazing
drakes verse probably ai too 😂😅
this pac verse is just so cold man its got the perfect mix of old school feel with new school flow
ive never seen someone self sabotage so fucking hard before. 50 pushups went hard as fuck. i wouldnt listen to this even if i had nothing else to do.
&quot;you supposed to be the boogeyman go do what you do&quot; line 🔥🔥🔥
not a single person has commented the lyrics
what y’all think will drop first, kendrick or gta6?
kendrick gonna body drake just like pusha t did i cant wait

took this man 3 weeks to respond. now he is trying to press somebody😂😂😂😂
yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn bullshit
omg
ain&#39;t nobody answering to taylor swift hip hop run the world boy!!!
👀👀🗣🗣‼️‼️this was complete 🔥 📛 👩‍🚒 🚒 🧯 🎆 🔥 📛  fire
oooooooo idk about all this, yes i do, it&#39;s crap, thats not how pac raps.
2pac would&#39;ve never collabed with this weirdo lol if 2pac was around drake would still be on degrassi high....
summoning jutsu is crazy
drake trying to hard
he won and i aint a fan, creativity at his best
we all can’t imagine how much fun drizzy and 40 must have had making this🤣
that pac voice doesn&#39;t suit the drake flow at all 💀
corny some yellow ninja sht
you don&#39;t bring others on a diss track. drake did it. nicki did it.<br><br>this is bitchmade stuff. what the fuck part of the game is this?
dranos
bro using dead people to help him fight.
this was trash drake 🗑️🚮
breezy anda drizzy won the war
he is killing this man 😂
this beat slaps!!!
trash 🤷🏽‍♂️
is that snoop or nipsey?😂😂😂😂😂😂
yooooooo new mf era 💨💨💨
50 said he seen this before it won’t end well for kdot …. this is kind of a page from 8 mile when em as rabbit dissed himself… and it seem like it was nothing left to say … when they put drakes voice on the ice spice song it was that moment the industry wanted to get control of it before people made money off of their voices … that law just got passed where they get paid and drake jumped on that wave 1st …. this is now at another level
5d chess moves by drake, impressive
where are the lawyers for tupac’s estate…😒
instant classic for the new times. it sounds so smooth that it doesn&#39;t even sound like a diss track. brilliant work, drake 👏 kendrick. you gotta respond my g. 😂
dudes letting ai write his raps now and yall still don’t believe he has ghost writers? lmao children fr
the 5th great hip hop war &amp; drizzy is sasuke 🤷🏾‍♂️
it will be funny if kendrick and taylor make a diss track
lmao someone said ovorochimaru but i lost the comment tht was fire tho😂😂😂
snoop: when tf did i say that cuhz?!?!
masterpiece
lmao i hole taylor sees this shit charla probably sent it to her instantly 😂😂😂
drake said “yall wanna 20v1? bet lemme get the west coast legends”🤣🤣
dope but who else is no with this ai shit
this shit too hard 🤦🏾‍♂️🔥
how can you get a disstrack from a dead person.. there is no respect...
trash
drake created an endless rap pipeline by pluging the ai rapper to his ghostwriters! nice job drake you just replaced the entire industry by yourself!
naaaaah, naaaah naaaah ninja <br>so cold
drake has 100% gained my full attention back. dude is absolutely trolling kendrick out of the game.
bro drake taking trolling to another level!😂
drake vs 20 rappers at the same time i&#39;m still betting on drake tho
i wonder if drake purposely made the ai tupac have his flow...cuz that is in no way sounding like tupac
that last &quot;on the loose &quot; was from the ovo owl himself
as a kendrick fan, dispite drake taking 2 weeks to respond to the first diss initially. he quickly followed that up with this where he came up with the concept, the lyrics, recorded and dropped the track…. i would think drake is an easy target for someone like dot so him taking his time on the rebuttal is a little disappointing. let’s keep it unbiased, drake is def up one rn smh
drake learned this from watching battle raps
is it me or does ai 2pac and ai snoop sound exactly like drakes ghost writer?
when did industry puppets begin to call out industry puppets? 🤔
i just thought about something. drake may have woke a beast 🔥🔥 and not realized. i wonder how dre day feel about this. i know he not gun let kdot go out like this i know for a fact<br><br>if kendrick was smart he would lock in with dre and use one of them detox beats and kill drake on it .....end of discussion.
let’s be real… is it not a pussy move to make snoop dog say what drake really wanted to say because drake knows he’s never touched anybody or been jail in his life either so he made snoop say it 👎🏾😂
i was gonna comment but what tf do i say 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
this is 🔥
still not good enough going against someone like kendrick
all this time and ghost writers and ai and this is all we get
wtf is going on
say what you want, but i know kendrick is going to have a field day of content for drake using ai.<br><br>what a time to be alive.
ngl this shit sound wack asf, whoever made this need their rights to cooking stripped asap😂
shuuu, what drake did here with al voice it&#39;s something i still need time to consume
drake going in!!! 🤣😂🤣😂
fail bruv.. disrespectful on a level that cant be articulated.
i heard this song on 8 mile when eminem disabled every shot ... nice photocopy mate from aus..
tupac’s verse sound like drake never heard tupac, for me it is disrespectfull
drake rhyming one syllable throughout the whole track is just disrespectful fr
anyone remember when t.i pissed on drake in a movie theater lmao
before yall try to say they were both actors and rappers.. just remember how pac carried himself...
&quot;nephew, what the fuck you really bout to do&quot;😂👍
that &quot;kendrick we need ya&quot; and that &quot;nephew&quot; followed by that &quot;yeah unc&quot; 😢😢😢
the playback on this shit is wild just hearing that pac and snoop on this beat.
making pac look like a pussy is driving me crazy. this is lame asf. canada should be embarrassed by this. the six should be embarrassed by this.
damn… ( kendrick’s next drop title)
y’all can hate if you want, this shit 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
drake forgot pac wouldn&#39;t roll with snitch snoop if he was alive
mennn dis shit is dope <br>and i&#39;m a kendrick fan <br>please kendrick you&#39;ve got to reply the mf
kendrick is done😂😂😂😂
lmao drakes gna get deeeeeeestroyed the fukn anticipation is killing me 😂<br>same energy drake had with pusha t 😂 real confidant 😂
bro this is sooooo fukn weak
”kendrick we need ya”
we have a canadian nerd disrespecting a legend. it&#39;s the audacity
kdot garbage.. overrated and got cooked by both jcole and drake. he started a war he can’t finish.
delete this man
what the hell bro
this is creative and trash at the same time…the contradictions…the hypocrisy…i really don’t know how to explain it. this man has immunity he can’t really lose…he has the numbers but he know he will never have the culture…nor does he care, in the grand scheme of things 🤷🏾‍♂️
i keep coming back
the dre  inspired beat so clean i&#39;m stuck between laughing and crying. i&#39;m happy im live for this shit on god
we&#39;re all grateful for drizzy but no one more then me!⛹
kinda lame
unless drake wrote 2pac and snoop verses this is weak honestly and corny. if drake wrote these verse i’ll say it’s legendary idea as well as evil…<br><br>i’m not feeling making songs using legends voices to create a song as if they exist.. technology went too far
my favorite parts are &quot;nephew&quot; and &quot;on the loooooo&quot;
drake used the thanos glove to travel back in time and get pac for this one 😂😅
pac ai. what is this?!
bro if drake pull this off over the whole game he enters the goat conversation. never been a rapper take on 10+ rappers/ singers/ producers at the same time
elegant, god like tbch.
it pains me that drake is winning this battle 😭
as soon as he booted up tupacgpt drake folded bro
drake is the greatest to ever do it. its over
imagine kendrick actually brings snoop in his diss 😂
i&#39;ve heard of jacking for beats but damn rappers taking voices now.? i wonder how this is going to turn out lol.
bro tried to 8 mile liking lil girls?
garbage
pac flow was lame. don&#39;t ever do this again. it sounded like spoken word being read from a piece of paper with no passion. pac would never!
snoop got a story about how tupac and drake were viding in the studio to create this track.
somewhere travis kelsey clapping taylor listening to this like he on the looooose
drake trash af for this track frfr 😒
drake the type of guy to ride around listening to his own music
drake just evened the odds with the ai features. now it’s 20vs♾️
a.i. dr. dre on the production...🤣😭☠️..dis shit hard tho..he a fool...dumb creative and witty tho...people using a.i. bout to go nuts now that a artist in the league on the level that drake is at this point in his career just gave people gas to do this more.
they just better pray wayne dont enter this shyt with drake....no survivors on that side
this shit really is a drake flow type beat 😂
you tryna let this die down naaahhh naaahhh naaahhh 👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾👋🏾
not him making his own teammates 💀
drizzy up
kendrick went from boogeyman to missing man<br>😂
this was really fire.
y’all still accusing this man of having a ghost writer while he literally writing for ghost
this is wack lol
i need this on spotify
drake went orochimaru on that man 🤦🏽
if this songs not in gta 6 ima riot
this shit so tuff man. drake winning against them all 🔥🔥🔥 me against the world mode for sure
&quot;quinntoupal entendre&quot; is crazy
taylor swift up wondering how she got pulled into a rap beef.
firstly, i enjoy hearing tupac shakur because he is one of the realest souls that has walked. i believe he is proud of the competition. <br>tupac put on danny boy and he is in a alternative lifestyle. <br>so i believe tupac would eventually grow to respect drake if still alive. <br>overall, i enjoyed this song. <br>spirit of tupac definitely has his  hands on this project and also that new tupac ai album that dropped recently. <br>i’m glad that the young peeps get to listen.<br>hope the art stays strong and no violence. <br>blessings to both drake and kendrick. 🙏🏼
it&#39;s funny how drake won&#39;t let up about kendricks height.
i wonder if this has anything to do with the poem by tupac on kendrick’s tpab album and how snoop was on that album too. and people consider tpab one of the goat albums, so another layer to it?
give a fuck about the quintuple entendres, i wanna hear kendrick going at drake’s neck like he like that.
i can&#39;t lie this was a smart move by drake. i know the kendrick stans will call this corny but this was very creative 🔥🔥🔥🦉😈
ai weak af
on da loooooo🤣
told me the spirit of mackavelli is alive in a nigga under 5 foot 5 so it’s gotta be you 😂😂😂😂 tupac saying that’s is the best thing of this song
how is this channel connected to drake for it to get the releases
he killed me when he said &quot;on the looooooose&quot; these lightskins be wilding when they in the zone 😂😂😂
he a ghost ghost writer 😂😂
his ghost writers have ghosts 👻 😂
drake really the goat bro! boy out here really begging for smoke! the boy is on demon time!
this is a huge landmark in the history of rap
the. bombs. yes. they. both. collaborated. to. do. this. is. fire
“shoutout taylor swift biggest gangsta in the music game rn” 😂😂
that’s funny as fuck
using a dead man&#39;s voice to justify your taste for underage women is not a w.
oooh drake u probably made another enemy..snoop aint gonna love this
how to bark up the wrong tree and then- get your head popped in a crowded room 🥶🔥
drake knows something about kendrick. and i feel kendrick is regretting dissing drake because drake will blow up the world with something about dots private life 😬<br><br>kendrick wanted to keep it rap but with disses anything is free game lol i thought he knew he messed with the pettiest one 😂
idk if i can respect the ai manipulation of 2pac like that. i think it sets a really poor precedent for the future.
snapping on a whole new level 😳🔥🔥
one thing drake and cole fans got in common is lack of 🐱🤝
this is terrible 😂
garbage 👎🏾
im sorry this was trash 😂😂
give this man his props.....all his opps coming for him.   he holding his own by himself.  this song is very creative, genius.  drake is not falling off anytime soon.
this lame
this beat sounds like one that came out years ago. is this literally the same one?
wack af
k dot you ask for it <br>where you at!
fam that 3rd verse crazy
oh me, oh my 😂😅
best verse snoop&#39;s has in years🤫....😂
nahhhhhh,im really about to go to a  studio and record a verse with mj.thanks for the idea drake.😂😂😂😂😂
hello there dion tillman here,,where is, this happen
as a kendrick fan, push ups was lite, wasnt all that. but this shit stings alil man. im jus in disbelief, nigga used ai tupac n snoop...damnn. but ik kendrick finna come back w some game changing shit tho
he&#39;s such a baby lol
here’s a chorus i came up with because i don’t know how to make beats. i want to get riches. to get rich is to hit switches. thank me later aka free use.
drake so used using ghost writer&#39;s.  no surprised he used a 2pac ai.
dude had to ressurect 2pac to battle
this was light work, more like drake old song, charged up!! kendrick bout to turn tf up on you drake, but u up 2-1 rn
🗑 - using pac, dmx never liked drake and pac sure as hell wouldnt like pop boy drake.
nope taylor swift is in the pop category shes not a rapper this is lame😭
💔a.i pac cloned voice no
no way mfs are calling this masterful trolling😭😭 kendrick about to destroy this man
i’m old and confused 😫 did ai or drake write ai pac and ai snoop bars?
admitting to being a nonce is not the 8-mile em strategy drake thinks it is
kendrick bout 2 ether yo ass. ⏸️
drake embodied the essence of pac and snoop<br> people don&#39;t even understand how he re did their flows which shows how skilled he is. more than just the voices . this dude is killing it🔥
🙏🏾 <b>edo tensei</b>
this is 🗑️
y&#39;all talking about drake never responded to pusha t diss, i listen to sway in the morning every morning they brought that specific topic up, correct me if i&#39;m wrong i believe sway basically said &quot;j prince told drake don&#39;t release it, let him make it&quot; not in those exact word, but you get the picture
this fake?
what if this is all a setup for a new collab album between drake x kendrick 😂
corny as fuck
this shit trash
that&#39;s corny
you a piece of shit for using ai to bring pac voice in this he would probably slap you .....and  snoop .... dude .... way out of pocket ..... you realize you might want to watch your back for real get more body gaurds
wish i had 2 extra hands to give this 4 👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽👎🏽
ass
snoop dogg got this on repeat 😂
i don&#39;t care if it&#39;s ai snoop and 2tupac.  this here is dope as hell
thats point, match,game.
this shit trash
i’m sorry, but this shit is corny. pac doesn’t even rap like that.
nah, using someone else&#39;s voice for a battle is a loss.  it&#39;s like you knew your voice and image was too weak, so you tried to channel someone else&#39;s to get the job done. <br>drake knows his nasal voice and monotone delivery can&#39;t really go head-to-head with the ferocious energy of kendrick&#39;s delivery wild word play. <br>styles make fights, and sometimes styles lose fights.
this is 🗑️
this why drake is genius, nobody was expecting this 🔥🔥🔥
trash
drake hella funny he said call him a bitch for me lol
“got to leave this mf broken and bruised”…grrrr
this is actually pretty good
chat gbt gamgster
quintuple entendre something i don’t even understand we waiting on you lml
this was genuinely of drake ,ppl will always have things to say.lets go! big bait,now respond ken
what the fuck is all this shit
i told yall tupac still alive makaveli returns yeeeeeeee
drake messed up not recording the pac verse in his voice cause he definitely wrote that
this beat is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2 light skinned r&amp;b singers killing the rap game right now. ya’ll disappointing.
drake&#39;s ghostwristers don&#39;t sleep
this is fake
marshall sitten somewhere, listening to every word, like &quot;please, please....somebody mention haley!&quot; he probably writing already, just in case.
&quot;on the loooooooooooooooooose&quot; the boy is a menace 😂
i guess u need another week to improve was just rude 😂 kendrick needs to drop something quick
this is bullshit. drake a hoe for this. why would you use ai?
drake been murdering dudes when it comes to beef… i’m not sure why y’all even thought kendrick had a chance in the first place.  drake holding all the infinity stones right now he thanos. 🫰🏽
blasphemy at its finest gd job tupac is still alive. who is known as akilthemc “i kill the microphone controller” <br>drake ur downfall is next 😂<br>ovo represents as the modern day oto who founded illuminati same masonic orders just different players. <br>you ppl gassed off ai missing the whole fact about this bs  guy 😂🤡<br>and kendrick lamar n mozzy is the same person. <br>has everyone forgotten that these celebs play multiple roles stop getting fooled. they are energy manipulators
this ai diss stuff is weak
this is shit 2pac, and snoop dog would hate this shit . drake, you should realize your shit rapper. you aint about that life . snoop and 2pac would pop  you
so far kendrick has only said his last album was bad.....and drake goes to this extent?? seems like an inferiority complex 😂 i think we know who won
😂😂😭 breakbeat media suge podcast brought me here. kendrick just got murked by ai pac, snoop, &amp; drake 😭 pac rooting for you 😂
j. cole sacrificed his reputation so drake could get the soul stone.
hard 🔥 📛 👩‍🚒
ai snoop dog 😂
nobody wants to work with him cause he fake as fuck and he the biggest industry puppet
my fuckin boy cooking
drake needs to be charged for xxx murder he&#39;s part of it
drake wrote those rap on snoop and pac verses i know his flow
disrespectful
at lease you 2 pac flow come on funny pac don&#39;t rap like this... snoop part sound like nipsey hustle...
🤮 disrespectful to the deceased
as a joe budden fan the rapper not the gossiper i&#39;m happy to know that pac knows who joe is.
snoop smoked too much and forgot which side he’s on.
when tupac does a diss song he makes “hit em up” <br><br>when someone else tries to be tupac, you make this…<br><br>stop trying to be tupac, stick to what you’re good at making fun club music.  <br><br>none of you rappers are hard.
clever move!
the bars immaculate sir
he got to use ai to do his dirty work for him? drake played himself with this.
i go back ever brow🎉🎉
i’m sorry but this is fire. aside from the conversation about the ethics of using a.i to mimic a deceased rap legend, you have to give drake his flowers for pushing the envelope here. drake fan or not.
drake just upper mooned 1 upper moon 3 hahaha
never thought i&#39;d see the day where drake lyrically b!tch slaps kdot left and right
everybody vs drake so he made his own ai teammates 😂
this diss track is hard 🔥🔥🔥💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
juice wrld ai?
drake win😂 fuck you motherfuckers , drake was one genio
snoop dogg a ghost from the past at this point, he a relic
shit wack lol
good move drake 💯 shit was great ... trolling at its finest 🤣😅😂
will smith somewhere mad that he is now connected to this
i know this isn&#39;t a thing.... we really not letting this slide....
we just sitting back with popcorn listening to all these disses bro i hope this brings real hip hop back 😂
mom, this one signed his contract with death, drake, he screwed up. this man is going to run out of money and end up on the street or dead😮😮😮
“that motherfucker don’t miss man” <br>“in the heat of battle he don’t miss”<br>“in the heat of controversy he don’t miss” - <br>snoop dogg 🤣🤦🏾‍♂️
can&#39;t lie this shtt fire whoa ! bangger bangger !

what a performance
this shit getting played on the radio it’s over pac my favorite rapper n i don’t mind it we kno it’s not really him relax n enjoy the chess match

anyone know who made this beat??
this the coldest diss in hip-hip history 🥶🥶🥶
damn. so disrespectful i hope its real. nah fam we watching the raplimpics bro🤣
madara vs the shinobi alliance
this is fake 😂😂😂 drake used a dead rapper and snoops old ass to get back at kendrick nah this ain&#39;t real😂😂😂 what happened to the magic 3 dream team😂😂😂<br><br>drake is still doing it for a check taylormade😂😂
when i heard snoop say “shower shoes” i knew for a fact he never did time. not even got arrested. tell me i’m lying.
why they make tupacs flow sound so bad smh
drake has too much confidence, this mf knows something.<br><br>he even said it on the push-ups diss too.
kendrick lost😊
“run back to home girl to run her numbers up”….swiftys
this sh!t was wack!!!!
don&#39;t matter if it&#39;s ai or nah, shit exits and slaps hard too,ef j cole
ded food!
the track is not appreciated whatsoever. tupac does not even spit like this! 😂😂
drake cant lose because hes simply smarter
foot on the neck.
drake aka madara/thanos/fmab father/broly 😂😂😂
thanos drake using the infinity stones to revive 2pac and using fake snoop for this track
yo honestly i never was a drake fan ,gotta give it to him tho this shit is lit didnt think he had it in him
drake bodied kenny
thanos
drake is in his madara arc
5th great shinobi war

bruh am sorry to say but drizzy be trolling and violating kdot. he be putting sniper dot on k’s forehead….
this is fucking garbage
that is not drakes voice
this is lame af. pac flow artificial as fuck.
bla bla bla. no depth to it in my opinion. just bla bla bla even with the ai generated pac voice.
you can tell that&#39;s drake behind that ai flow 🔥
“you supposed to be the bogeyman go do what you do.” 🤣🤣
beat good tho. all artificial lol smh
rap getting corny no lie
sickest beat so far
&quot;3am in compton&quot; finna go hard. in ovo we trust
had to pull a skeleton outa hat just to battle k dot.   <br>ai sound like daylyt on psych meds. just plain no emotion
and the beat is scandalous... 🔥 🔥 🔥
kendrick is finished, rest in piss
this is satanic!!!
drake gonna drop a weak ass response as ai kendrick. lol
wait how tf ??
yo!!!!!!!!,drake went raw on my nigga!!
guys if you really listen,drake is dissing the whole west coast on this track!!,something has to be done about this!😮
dude said...talking loose like im not in the room.... this mf got eyes and ears in kendrick&#39;s camp😂
this like when 2 teams match up well on paper but when they on the field . one team just destorys the other
it’s over drake killed this guy
you think 40 made the beat?
love y&#39;all but i&#39;m just saying this song is better i don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the beat or maybe if y&#39;all seem to look at salty or whatever just trying to get some constructive criticism
this dude took 3 weeks to respond but disses kendrick for not responding fast enough… 🤦
fuck!!shitt!!butters!!they kill kenny again!!!😂😂😂
tupac would never rap like that 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
kendrick we need ya 🗣️
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣genius!!!
the beat is mad🔥🔥🔥
2nd disstrack w 2pac has 2 millions in 2 days... <br>it&#39;s 2 disrespectful 🪡🦉
you can hear drake’s pen in all the verses!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
2 pac rapping like drake
drake won this one. the war is over.
so we actually gonna give this clown props for making a fake ass diss track???
said a bunch of nothing
how much you have to be loser to ue a ai of pac to diss some one
next he going make a diss track with ai kendrick against kendrick
well kendrick 😮
wow drake&#39;s body count is getting crazy
this is disturbing
it would take jay z to come out of retirement to fuck with drake
y&#39;all didnt catch that &quot;loose&quot; he talking about kendricks wife
lame 😒
o drake talking to that nigga shit hard as hell 🔥
i&#39;m wit kdot in this beef...yes i&#39;mbias af but i love hip hop and drake got him in a scope wit a head shot on this...k dot needs to respond before the week is over aint no way hell you let these tracks slide so you can wait for your album...fuck that on the west its immediate retaliation
drake put ai snoop on him 😅😅
flight be like: wait how did tupac come back from the dead?
the beat is so simple but so good
kendrick is really gonna either make this die down or put a diss on a surprise album
i can’t even lie this funny asf, haven’t been this entertained in years 😂
drakes eminem level with battle tactics!! this is very very clever!! kendrick literally has to come with fire!! after hearing the like that verse i&#39;m not sure what else he can do 😂😂
holy
aye drake aint playing no games kendrick gotta do a ether type diss to beat drake
honestly hearing illuminate before a piano beat kicks in got me on some nostalgia high. god i miss pac.
1 subscriber 10 push ups
idk instead of being negative ima be positive, hearing tupac (ai) spit a verse in a different style kinda dope
this shit actually hot as fuck
i’m a kendrick fan but this song is 🔥
drake so lonely he gotta rap with ai
this is so cold
this sounds gay
let’s talk about this beat 🔥
“unless this is that moment you tell us this is not really you” he was throwing jabs at j.cole for apologising and saying the rap diss wasn’t really him.
this is trash 😂
dawg this some eminem 8mile shit, beat him to some of the punch to snatch material from kendrick
this is the top troll of the year. god damn this is good.
as a huge makaveli fan i got pissed when i heard this especially cause drake made ai say “they told me the spirit of makaveli was alive in a dude under 5’5 so is gotta be u”
i predict tupac coming back and dropping a diss track lol
bro dissed himself on his own diss truck cuz kendrick lamar taking too long
this is amazing
cringe!!!😬
2pac and snoop both sound like ai
kanye gonna burn your ass drake. he done gave you a little bite, but he just warming up.
i ain’t gone hold this harder than 50 push ups 😂they both fire but this is crazy for so many reasons 🤦🏽‍♂️
drake like cole yo bihh azz wanna bow out <br>imma get pac and snoop on yo azz
i ain&#39;t gonna lie i&#39;m a kendrick fan but this s*** is hot especially when drake rapped at the end 💯
when drizzy said on the looooose that really declared victory to me…. 🎉
drake&#39;s day - kendrick lamar (ft. j. cole) the collaboration that the fans have been waiting for.
very creative with the 2pac and snoop a.i version but i&#39;m gonna have to agree with jess  hilarious, drake said a whole lot of nothing
what is this shit? not only does he not write his own rhymes now hes gotta use ai to rap with him, thats some weirdo shit right here using an ai pac and snoop voice for anything, let alone a diss track. can this dude get any more whack...
not denying but rather playing along? this dudes setting himself up for failure no matter how cool it sounds lol
tooo impressive
why this beef got game 7 nba finals vibes
lame
nephew 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
drake just won
garbage 😂 straight garbage 😂
ghost writers going crazy
ai been way better than this at voices... it sounds like pac but hes way more grown...
he really needed tupac and snoop voice is lame asf to me 😭🥲
this goes hard
kendrick has to use a ai version of drakes son and father and name it dad why did you try to hide me from the world or he’s cooked
wtf is this shit lol
genius👍🏽
edo tensei of rap 😂😂
this is the music equivalent of trying to land a low blow while actually missing the shot by a mile
this is kind of concerning around the whole ethics or whatever of using ai voices
nugga tryna use that b.rabbit from 8 mile diss strategy
this is not the heart part 5
drake fans trying so hard to make drake seem he winning bro is a clown rn 😂😂😂
k dot about to drop a whole album fussing drake.
jada definitely getting ptsd listening to this 😭😭
😂😂😂😂😂 drake you made my whole week
damn kendrick 😭
hes funny as fuck for this i wanna know wtf he got on kendrick to be this fucking hype
let him cook
drake is crazy, banger
it took drake team  3 weeks to respond but he want kdot to respond asap. that’s crazy
wow drake is really entertaining himself 👏👏 amazing
diddy diddled the disney right out of this guy.
corny
that boy drake 😮😮😮😮😮😮
drake is up!!!!!!! for this one
top
trash and disrespectful 😂😂😂
had no idea jrake from disney channel made songs! i thought he went over to nickelodeon
drake really making chess moves
wheres his response to adidon?
3 days straight
dw worry drake dot gon haven an entendre u can understand
drake did kendrick worst than he did meek. (no diddy)
dranos. <br><br>“they made me the villain i couldn’t escape!”<br><br>damn
drake just pull a orochimaru move, that&#39;s for sure 3th war
dot fans sweating right now lol
are kidding me, this shit crazy
using pac and snoops voice is sooo wack 👎🏾
so can snoop sue drake over this or is it not an official release so it’s allowed? no way he should be able to profit off their voices like that
lame as fuck!!!
lmao, imagine thinking tupac would support pop stars like drake. <br><br>drake is what swifties listen to when they want to be hard
drake reaches a new low. this song is the second worst thing that happened to tupac
this is such a 50 cent type beat
i&#39;m cool with drakes verses but ai rap verses is weak.
next drake vs himself using k-dot ai vocals🤖  <br>😂😂😂😂😂
naahhhh drake took a huge l with this one. kendrick never claimed to be a gangmember, always said he was affiliated and that made gkmc such a classic album. how it is to grow up surrounded by violence while not being a part of it. second drake claiming kendrick ain&#39;t dropping because of taylot swift while he only leaks this so his numbers cant be compared to taylor is weak as fuck. now saying kendrick has to hurry to respond, while it almost took him a month to respond is another hypocritic weak jab. fuck drake for this one.
drake bought all the front rows tickets of kendrick’s mind and they’re all empty
business had been stood on
yall mf&#39;s lack critical thinking in these comments and its funny to laugh at all of you silly individuals
hi in the sky like how are you..?
no way he was so mad he made another song already and that he was so passionate about the anger he made it a freestyle like bruh musta been mad about the ai or ghost writers comments 💀 i didn&#39;t listen to this yet but something tells me this isn&#39;t real or he wrote down the freestyle l tryna get recognition and homage 👎 drake&#39;s 🗑️ been said that now you guys finally see it, waite till you hear what i got say about eminem 🤫 puts the cob in corny even though i take great influence 😤
bruhh😂😂😂
can you imagine if pac was still alive?!?!
ohhhh shittttt aubrey went tf innnn 🔥🔥🔥
pac would never approve of this corn ball ish🤦🏿‍♂️
search &quot;dopfunk tupac&quot; to see how bad and how much of a disrespect this was to tupac having drakes rubbish mumble flow with tupacs voice<br><br>search it before replying as no way your telling me i&#39;m wrong if you do
quantuple entandre is actually craayyyyyzyyyy 😂
that &quot;nah nah nah &quot; 😂😂😂funny af
weak
kendrick could never
i mean have anybody heard from kendrick😂
sickest diss track so far
drake took &quot;ghost writers&quot; literally 😂💀
you know it’s not actually snoop…homie didn’t mention cripping or the lbc once.
1 million of views ? that’s a real lyrical war
soon as u get the courage to drop i&#39;m out on the loose😭😭
it’s crazy how easy it was for whoever to create a dre sounding beat.
this is terrible
naw.have nothing against drake but this ass.check the update.these comments ain’t aging well.ppl like anything.using a.i for diss tracks now. 💩
wtf has gotten into aubrey bro!? damn...
drake take your l not even the late great pac can help you
use other legends voice its funny 🤷‍♂️
hearing tupac go into a drake cadance is wild af lol
clown move
kendrick have to diss with drake ai
that ai bs gotta go. 🗑️. snoop ain&#39;t it either. big l all around. kendrick need to body aubrey already
nah for drake to just kinda talk to kendrick on some, im waiting shit, where the new music at is wild 😭💀
its funny how yall say if pac was alive he wouldnt do this or wouldnt do that... wtf yall know bout a dead man&#39;s perspective...lol drake definitely cooking our boy here 😂 damn!
beat is fire🔥🔥 this is a troll song btw not a diss drake still waiting on the little midget while trying new things. 😂
wtf smh luv from brooknam
this lowky kinda fire
drake is loving this he&#39;s been waiting his whole career for this moment 🤣

ye getting pegged to this while kennifer watches
kendrick need to throw in the towel 😂😂😂
this shit is lame.
drake is the definition. kendrick is probably the better rapper, but drake is the harder worker. we have to wake up early and go to bed late and do that every day to fuck with drake y’all stop acting like this man don’t outwork kendrick that alone gets my vote
very dope responses from, champagne, but no one’s gone bump these in the club. right now “like that” is the winning record. kendrick is bout to come back with something crazy!
